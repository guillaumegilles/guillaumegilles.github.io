We see and use data in our everyday lives.\n\nIn this course, you will learn how to organize and summarize data. Organizing\nand summarizing data is called **descriptive statistics**. Two ways to summarize\ndata are by graphing and by using numbers (for example, finding an average).\nAfter you have studied probability and probability distributions, you will use\nformal methods for drawing conclusions from \"good\" data. The formal methods are\ncalled **inferential statistics**. Statistical inference uses probability to\ndetermine how confident we can be that our conclusions are correct.\n\nEffective interpretation of data (inference) is based on good procedures for\nproducing data and thoughtful examination of the data. You will encounter what\nwill seem to be too many mathematical formulas for interpreting data. The goal\nof statistics is not to perform numerous calculations using the formulas, but\nto gain an understanding of your data. The calculations can be done using a\ncalculator or a computer. The understanding must come from you. If you can\nthoroughly grasp the basics of statistics, you can be more confident in the\ndecisions you make in life.\n\n## Probability\n\n**Probability** is a mathematical tool used to study randomness. It deals with\nthe chance (the likelihood) of an event occurring. For example, if you toss a\nfair coin four times, the outcomes may not be two heads and two tails. However,\nif you toss the same coin 4,000 times, the outcomes will be close to half heads\nand half tails. The expected theoretical probability of heads in any one toss\nis $\\frac{1}{2}$ or $0.5$. Even though the outcomes of a few repetitions are\nuncertain, there is a regular pattern of outcomes when there are many\nrepetitions.\n\nThe theory of probability began with the study of games of chance such as\npoker. Predictions take the form of probabilities. To predict the likelihood\nof an earthquake, of rain, we use probabilities. Doctors use probability to\ndetermine the chance of a vaccination causing the disease the vaccination is\nsupposed to prevent. A stockbroker uses probability to determine the rate of\nreturn on a client's investments. You might use probability to decide to buy\na lottery ticket or not. In your study of statistics, you will use the power\nof mathematics through probability calculations to analyze and interpret\nyour data.\n\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obZzOq_wSCg >}}\n\n\n\n## Key Terms\n\nIn statistics, we generally want to study a **population**. You can think\nof a population as a collection of persons, things, or objects under study.\nTo study the population, we select a **sample**. The idea of **sampling** is\nto select a portion (or subset) of the larger population and study that portion\n(the sample) to gain information about the population. Data are the result of\nsampling from a population.\n\nBecause it takes a lot of time and money to examine an entire population,\nsampling is a very practical technique. If you wished to compute the overall\ngrade point average at your school, it would make sense to select a sample of\nstudents who attend the school. The data collected from the sample would be\nthe students' grade point averages. In presidential elections, opinion poll\nsamples of 1,000–2,000 people are taken. The opinion poll is supposed to\nrepresent the views of the people in the entire country. Manufacturers of\ncanned carbonated drinks take samples to determine if a 16 ounce can contains\n16 ounces of carbonated drink.\n\nFrom the sample data, we can calculate a **statistic**. A statistic is a\nnumber that represents a property of the sample. For example, if we consider\none math class to be a sample of the population of all math classes, then the\naverage number of points earned by students in that one math class at the end\nof the term is an example of a statistic. The statistic is an estimate of a\npopulation **parameter**, in this case the mean. A parameter is a numerical\ncharacteristic of the whole population that can be estimated by a statistic.\nSince we considered all math classes to be the population, then the average\nnumber of points earned per student over all the math classes is an example\nof a parameter.\n\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPM84_yfx5Q& >}}\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Is statistics accurate?\n\nOne of the main concerns in the field of statistics is how accurately a\nstatistic estimates a parameter. The accuracy really depends on how well the\nsample represents the population. The sample must contain the characteristics\nof the population in order to be a representative sample. We are interested\nin both the sample statistic and the population parameter in inferential\nstatistics. In a later chapter, we will use the sample statistic to test the\nvalidity of the established population parameter.\n:::\n\nA **variable**, usually notated by capital letters such as $X$ and $Y$, is a\ncharacteristic or measurement that can be determined for each member of a\npopulation. Variables may be **numerical** or **categorical**:\n\n- Numerical variables take on values with equal units such as weight in\npounds and time in hours.\n- Categorical variables place the person or thing into a category.\n\nIf we let $X$ equal the number of points earned by one math student at the\nend of a term, then $X$ is a numerical variable. If we let $Y$ be a person's\nparty affiliation, then some examples of $Y$ include Republican, Democrat, and\nIndependent. $Y$ is a categorical variable. We could do some math with values\nof $X$ (calculate the average number of points earned, for example), but it\nmakes no sense to do math with values of $Y$ (calculating an average party\naffiliation makes no sense).\n\nTwo words that come up often in statistics are **mean** and **proportion**.\nIf you were to take three exams in your math classes and obtain scores of $86$,\n$75$, and $92$, you would calculate your mean score by adding the three exam\nscores and dividing by three (your mean score would be $84.3$ to one decimal\nplace). If, in your math class, there are $40$ students and $22$ are men and $18$\nare women, then the proportion of men students is $\\frac{22}{40}$ and the\nproportion of women students is $\\frac{18}{40}$. Mean and proportion are\ndiscussed in more detail in later chapters.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Average or mean ?\n\nThe words \"mean\" and \"average\" are often used interchangeably. The substitution\nof one word for the other is common practice. The technical term is `arithmetic\nmean`, and \"average\" is technically a center location. However, in practice\namong non-statisticians, \"average\" is commonly accepted for `arithmetic mean`.\n:::\n\n## Exercices\n\n### Example 1\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Problem\n\nDetermine what the key terms refer to in the following study. We want to know\nthe average (mean) amount of money first year college students spend at ABC\nCollege on school supplies that do not include books. We randomly surveyed 100\nfirst year students at the college. Three of those students spent $150, $200,\nand $225, respectively.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Solution\n\n- The **population** is all first year students attending ABC College this term.\n- The **sample** could be all students enrolled in one section of a beginning\nstatistics course at ABC College (although this sample may not represent the\nentire population).\n- The **parameter** is the average (mean) amount of money spent (excluding\nbooks) by first year college students at ABC College this term: the population\nmean.\n- The **statistic** is the average (mean) amount of money spent (excluding\nbooks) by first year college students in the sample.\n- The **variable** could be the amount of money spent (excluding books) by one\nfirst year student. Let X = the amount of money spent (excluding books) by one\nfirst year student attending ABC College.\n- The **data** are the dollar amounts spent by the first year students. Examples\nof the data are $150, $200, and $225.\n:::\n\n### Example 2\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Problem\n\nDetermine what the key terms refer to in the following study.\n\nA study was conducted at a local college to analyze the average cumulative GPA’s\nof students who graduated last year. For each statement below find the\nappropriate statistical term.\n\n1. The cumulative GPA of one student who graduated from the college last year.\n2. 3.65, 2.80, 1.50, 3.90\n3. A group of students who graduated from the college last year, randomly selected.\n4. The average cumulative GPA of students who graduated from the college last year.\n5. All students who graduated from the college last year.\n6. the average cumulative GPA of students in the study who graduated from the\ncollege last year.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Solution\n\n1. Population: **5**\n2. Statistic: **6**\n3. Parameter: **4**\n4. Sample: **3**\n5. Variable: **1**\n6. Data: **2**\n:::\n\n### Example 3\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Problem\n\nDetermine what the key terms refer to in the following study.\n\nAs part of a study designed to test the safety of electric automobiles, the\nNational Transportation Safety Board collected and reviewed data about the\neffects of an automobile crash on test dummies. Here is the criterion they\nused:\n\n| Speed at which cars crashed |\tLocation of “drive” (i.e. dummies) |\n|:--------------------------- | :----------------------------------|\n| 35 miles/hour \t          | Front Seat                         |\n\nCars with dummies in the front seats were crashed into a wall at a speed of 35\nmiles per hour. We want to know the proportion of dummies in the driver’s seat\nthat would have had head injuries, if they had been actual drivers. We start\nwith a simple random sample of 75 cars.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Solution\n\n- The **population** is all cars containing dummies in the front seat.\n- The **sample** is the 75 cars, selected by a simple random sample.\n- The **parameter** is the proportion of driver dummies (if they had been real\npeople) who would have suffered head injuries in the population.\n- The **statistic** is proportion of driver dummies (if they had been real\npeople) who would have suffered head injuries in the sample.\n- The **variable** $X =$ whether a dummy (if it had been a real person) would\nhave suffered head injuries.\n- The **data** are either: yes, had head injury, or no, did not.\n:::\n\n## To recap\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.4     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD;\n    population[Population]==> |a portion (or subset) of the population|sample(Sample);\n    sample --> statistic(Statistic);\n    B --> D;\n    C --> D;\n```",
