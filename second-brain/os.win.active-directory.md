Active Directory, *AD*, is a directory service provided by Microsoft. It stores information about objects on the network and makes them accessible to administrators users to find and use.

"A domain represents a database. That database holds records about network services-things like computers, users, groups and other things that use, support, or exist on a network. The domain database is, in effect, Active Directory."
