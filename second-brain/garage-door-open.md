title: Garage Door Open
---

These days, one of the consequences of [[social media]] is a curated posts
proliferation of well-curated posts and accomplishments. More and more people
misunderstand what it takes to [[get thing done]] and the work behind the scenes.
We end up with mostly posts announcements of finished work.

On the opposite of this philosophy, [Andy Mutaschak](https://andymatuschak.org/)
loves to "work with the garage door up". What does it mean in the digital area:
publishing ongoing projects or posts that are written for oneself and not an
audience. In his words. it looks like "giving a lecture about the problems you’re
pondering in the shower; it’s thinking out loud about how your project doesn’t
work at all. I want to see the process. I want to see you trim the artichoke."
