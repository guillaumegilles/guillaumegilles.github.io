# Links and connection in zettelkasten

A sophisticated system of internal links between [[zettelkasten-notes]] makes
it possible to create connections between each independent note. This link
system is, neither more nor less, than the [[web-hyperlink]].

Luhmann sets up 3 types of notes with links:

1. When beginning a major reflection, Luhmann creates a skeleton to list the
   essential points to be addressed. We find similarities with the summary of a
   book.
2. A “thematic” map allows you to bring together important links with this
   theme.
3. Individual links between notes across the notes web.
