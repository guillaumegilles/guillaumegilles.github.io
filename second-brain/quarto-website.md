# Quarto website

## [Creating a Website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) with [[quarto]]

## [Website Preview](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/#website-preview)

```shell
# preview the website in the current directory
$ quarto preview

## Setup a Quarto website with [Github Pages](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html)

The simplest way to publish using GitHub Pages is to render to the docs
directory and then check that directory into your repository. If you prefer not
to check rendered output into version control see the discussion of using
Publish Command below.[1]
