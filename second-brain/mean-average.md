# Average or mean ?

The words "[[statistical-mean]]" and "average" are often used interchangeably.
The substitution of one word for the other is common practice. The technical
term is `arithmetic mean`, and "average" is technically a center location.
However, in practice among non-statisticians, "average" is commonly accepted
for `arithmetic mean`.
