** what is financial

financial stability is about the absence of system-wide episodes in which the
financial system fails to function (crises). It is also about *resilience* of
financial systems to stress.

** key takeaways

1) efficiently allocating resources, assessing and managing financial risks
2) maintaining employment levels close to the economyâ€™s natural rate
3) eliminating relative price movements of real or financial assets that will
affect monetary stability or employment levels
4) preventing adverse events from having a disruptive effect on the real
economy or on other financial systems
5) Financial stability is paramount for economic growth, as most transactions
in the real economy are made through the financial system
