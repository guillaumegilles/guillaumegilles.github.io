# Variables

A **variable**, usually notated by capital letters such as $X$ and $Y$, is a
characteristic or measurement that can be determined for each member of a
[[statistical-population]]. Variables may be **numerical** or **categorical**:

- Numerical variables take on values with equal units such as weight in
pounds and time in hours.
- Categorical variables place the person or thing into a category.

If we let $X$ equal the number of points earned by one math student at the
end of a term, then $X$ is a numerical variable. If we let $Y$ be a person's
party affiliation, then some examples of $Y$ include Republican, Democrat, and
Independent. $Y$ is a categorical variable. We could do some math with values
of $X$ (calculate the average number of points earned, for example), but it
makes no sense to do math with values of $Y$ (calculating an average party
affiliation makes no sense).
