An absolute path makes no assumptions about your current location in relation
to the location of the file or directory it's describing, as opposed to
[relative path](relative-path.qmd). An absolute path always begins from the
absolute start of your hard drive, _root_, and describes every step you must
take through the filesystem to end up at the target location.

Example:

```{bash}
$  /home/tux/example.txt
```
