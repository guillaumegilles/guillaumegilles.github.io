# Notes numerotation in zettelkasten

In Luhmann's system, notes are numbered by alternating alphabetical letters and
numerical sequences. For example, the note numbered `1.1.b.1` is a contribution
to the note `1.1.b`, itself an addition of the note `1.1`. These numbering rules
allow infinite ramification of a reflection. [@ImprovedTranslationCommunications2023]
