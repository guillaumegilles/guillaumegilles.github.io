# Digital Garden

Digital garden roots date back to 1998, when [Mark Bernstein](https://www.markbernstein.org/)
introduced the idea of the “hypertext garden” arguing for spaces on the internet
that let a person wade into the unknown. "Quiet spaces they can call their own".
A digital garden is rather different than a [[blog]]. "Rather than presenting a
set of polished articles, displayed in reverse chronological order, these sites
act more like free form, work-in-progress wikis.” [@appletonBriefHistoryEthos2020]
