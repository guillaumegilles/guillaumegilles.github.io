Different dealers may sell the same car for different prices. The sale prices for a articular car are normally distributed with a mean and standard deviation of $26$ thousand dollars and $2$ thousand dollars, respectively. Suppose we select one of these cars at random. Let $X =$ the sale price (in thousands of dollars) for the selected car. Find
$P(X > 25)$.

$$P(X > K)=P(z > \dfrac{K - \mu_X}{\sigma_X})$$

As a result,

$$P(X > 25) = P(z > \dfrac{25 - 26}{2})$$

$$= P(z > -0.5)$$

$$= 1 - P(z < -0.5)$$

$$\approx 1-0.3085 ~~~~\text{(from table)}$$

$$\approx0.6915$$
