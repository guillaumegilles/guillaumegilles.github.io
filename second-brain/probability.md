# Probability

is a mathematical tool used to study randomness. It deals with
the chance (the likelihood) of an event occurring. For example, if you toss a
fair coin four times, the outcomes may not be two heads and two tails. However,
if you toss the same coin 4,000 times, the outcomes will be close to half heads
and half tails. The expected theoretical probability of heads in any one toss
is $\frac{1}{2}$ or $0.5$. Even though the outcomes of a few repetitions are
uncertain, there is a regular pattern of outcomes when there are many
repetitions.

The theory of probability began with the study of games of chance such as
poker. Predictions take the form of probabilities, numbers from 0% (impossible)
to 100% (certain) that measures the chance something happens. To predict the
likelihood of an earthquake, of rain, we use probabilities.
