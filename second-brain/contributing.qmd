## CONTRIBUTING

Whereas [READMEs](readme.qmd) help people use the project, contributing docs
help people contribute to the project. It explains what types of contributions
are needed and how the process works. While not every project has a CONTRIBUTING
file, its presence signals that this is a welcoming project to contribute to. A
good example of an effective Contributing Guide would be the one from
[Codecademyâ€™s Docs repository](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/contribution-guide).
