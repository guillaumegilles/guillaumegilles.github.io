# Sample

In [[statistics]], we generally want to study a [[statistics-population]].
Because it takes a lot of time and money to examine an entire population,
select a **sample** is a very practical technique. To study the population.
The idea of sampling is to select a portion (or subset) of the larger population
and study that portion the sample to gain information about the population.
Data are the result of sampling from a population. [@illowskyIntroductoryStatistics2e2023]
