## Conduction

La **conduction** est le passage de la chaleur, d'un point à un autre d'un corps sous l'action d'une différence de température. Lorsqu’on tient une tasse de café dans les mains, la chaleur du café traverse de la tasse et réchauffe les mains.

The net conductive heat flow, _Q_, through an object is proportional to the difference in temperatures, _T_, across the object and the inherent thermal conductivity, _k_, of the object.

$$
Q \propto k \times \Delta T
$$

One place you see this relationship in action is when you wrap yourself in a blanket on a chilly day. Unless you're exercising, your body releases a more or less constant flow of heat to its surroundings.

But when you wrap yourself in a blanket, you're introducing a barrier to heat flow, corresponding to a lower _k_. In turn, less heat escapes, raising your skin temperature until the larger _ΔT_ across the blanket balances out the lower _k_.

Since your skin temperature has risen, thermoreceptors in your skin sense the increase in temperature and you feel nice and toasty.

    You're about to put a pot of water on the stove to cook some pasta, and you want to get the water boiling as fast as possible.

    You have metal (high thermal conductivity) and ceramic (low thermal conductivity) cookware. What combination of pot and lid should you use to get the water boiling the soonest?

If we want the water to reach boiling temperature as quickly as possible, we want to increase the net heat flow from the pot to the water, and minimize the heat flow from the water to the air above. That means we should use a metal pot (it will transfer heat from the flame to the water more readily than a ceramic pot will) and a ceramic lid (it will reduce heat flow from the water to the air above compared to a metal lid or no lid).

## Evaporation

    Andrei and Cristina would like to drink some tea, but they don't want to wait too long for it to cool down. They both make tea using half a mug of boiling water.

Andrei immediately fills the rest of his mug with water straight from the fridge. Cristina does the same, but after waiting ten minutes.

In this situation, the primary heat transfer mechanism is evaporation, which isn't directly proportional to ΔT like conduction. However, many of the same principles apply. In other words, the greater the difference in heat (ΔT), the faster the transfer of heat.

After Andrei fills up the remaining half of his cup with cold water, the temperature of the water is much lower than that in Cristina's cup. This means that the ΔT between Cristina's cup and the room temperature is much higher, so heat will transfer from Cristina's cup much faster.

Cristina's tea loses more heat over the ten minutes, so her cup will be at a lower temperature after she adds cold water.
