# Zettelkasten a analog system

When Niklas Luhman developed his [[zettelkasten]] system, personal computers,
[[internet]] and the [[web]] did not exist. He therefore makes an **analogous**
system, with a [[zettelkasten-index]], [[zettelkasten-notes]], and
[[zettelkasten-numerotation]] because to compensate for the lack of technology
available for his system. If he had modern technologies, his _zettelkasten_
would be completely different from what he was able to develop.

I think it is a mistake to want to recreate Luhman's system exactly, because it
meets (1) Luhman's personal needs, and (2) it was developed in a different era.
It is an anachronism to use modern tools to recreate an old system. Conversely,
everyone should keep the philosophy: cultivate their piece of knowledge, and set
up a **personalized** system.
