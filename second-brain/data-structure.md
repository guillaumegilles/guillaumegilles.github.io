Data structures are essential components that help organize and store data
efficiently in computer memory. They provide a way to manage and manipulate data
effectively, enabling faster access, insertion, and deletion operations. Common
data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs,
each serving specific purposes based on the requirements of the problem at hand.
Understanding data structures is fundamental for designing efficient algorithms
and optimizing software performance.
