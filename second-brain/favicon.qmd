A **favicon** (_avorite icon_) is a tiny icon included along with a
[website](website.qmd), which is displayed in places like the browser's address
bar, page tabs and bookmarks menu.

Note, however, that most modern browsers replaced the favicon from the address
bar by an image indicating whether or not the website is using HTTPS.

Usually, a favicon is 16 x 16 pixels in size and stored in the GIF, PNG, or
ICO file format.

They are used to improve user experience and enforce brand consistency. When a
familiar icon is seen in the browser's address bar, for example, it helps users
know they are in the right place.
