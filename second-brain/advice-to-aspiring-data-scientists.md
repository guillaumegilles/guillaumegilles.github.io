title: "Advice to aspiring data scientists: start a blog"
---

A blog is the best advice for someone wanted to start a data science career. It
helps to:

1. **Practice analyzing data and communicating about it**: it can be easily
   resumed to "practice makes perfect" or in French: "C'est en forgeant qu'on
   devient forgeron".
2. **Create a portfolio of your work and skills**: after spending hours and
   nights practicing your data science craft, a blog is a valuable medium to
   share your work. This piece of advice works well for established data
   scientists as well.
3. **Get feedback and evaluation**: creating a community and interacting with an
   audience helps individuals to reach for better.
