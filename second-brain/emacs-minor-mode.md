# [Emacs Minor Mode](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Minor-Modes.html)

A minor mode is an optional editing mode that alters the behavior of [[emacs]]
in some well-defined way. Unlike [[emacs-major-mode]], any number of minor modes
can be in effect at any time. The best example is [evil mode](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil)

minor mode is useful to customize one's workflow!
