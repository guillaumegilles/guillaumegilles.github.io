## Variables

- Variables are called "Variables" because the values they store can change.
- we don't need to "declare" spam_amount before assigning to it
- we don't need to tell Python what type of value spam_amount is going to refer
  to. In fact, we can even go on to reassign spam_amount to refer to a different
  sort of thing like a string or a boolean.
