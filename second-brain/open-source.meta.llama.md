Meta’s approach to open-source has changed radically from being an opaque and closed company to paising open-source. The reason to that is simple: the bottom line, **profit**.

> Unlike its big-tech peers, [Meta] makes money by showing ads to users, and does not operate a cloud business that sells LLM API calls. Meta has been badly bitten by its dependence on iOS and Android, which has left it vulnerable to Apple and Google hurting its business by imposing privacy controls that limit its ability to target ads precisely. Consequently, Meta has a strong incentive to support relatively open platforms that it can build upon and aren’t controlled by any one party. [@ngWhatIfLarge2024]
