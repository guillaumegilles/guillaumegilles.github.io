## Breakpoint

Next, set a breakpoint on line 2 of `hello.py` by placing the cursor on the `print` call and pressing **F9**. Alternately, click in the editor's left gutter, next to the line numbers. When you set a breakpoint, a red circle appears in the gutter.

## Initialize debugger

Next, to initialize the debugger, press **F5**. Since this is your first time debugging this file, a configuration menu will open from the Command Palette allowing you to select the type of debug configuration you would like for the opened file.

**Note**: VS Code uses JSON files for all of its various configurations; `launch.json` is the standard name for a file containing debugging configurations.
