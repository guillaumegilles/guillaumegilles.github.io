You donâ€™t need mayonnaise to make a beautiful Honey Mustard Dressing! Mine is made with just mustard, honey, cider vinegar and oil. Thatâ€™s all you need to make a beautiful creamy Honey Mustard Dressing that transforms even the plainest of salads intoÂ *wow!*

I use this Honey Mustard Dressing for salads but itâ€™s definitely thick enough to use as a dipping sauce too. Though truth be told, my Honey Mustard Dipping sauce is made with mayonnaise and no vinegar. ðŸ™‚ But I do use this for dipping too!

My friends and I always say that a great salad comes down to the dressing. It doesnâ€™t matter how fancy pants the ingredients in the salad are. If the dressing is a fail, then the salad is a fail.

But THIS dressing is always a guaranteed hit!!

PS The bottle in the photo above may be familiar to Australians. Itâ€™s sold at Woolworths, branded by a certain well known celebrity chef who shall remain unnamed. However, itâ€™s very impractical for dressings. Firstly because you have to hold your finger on the top of the pourer when you shake it. Secondly, the bottle has to be more than half full in order for the dressing to pour into the funnel. Humph. Not happy!

I do like to experiment with dressings, but when it comes down to it, I always fall back on my sure-fire winners. And Honey Mustard Dressing is definitely falls into that category. It truly does make everything better. Whether just used to dress plain leafy greens, or with a few cherry tomatoes added, which is all I did (see photo at top), or for a salad with more substantial ingredients. Like my Roasted Sweet Potato Salad. This dressing would be fantastic with that!

Though made with honey, this is not an overly sweet dressing. Iâ€™m more of a savoury than sweet girl, so my savoury foods with sweetness in them always errs more towards savoury than sweet. It sounds like there is a lot of honey in this, but actually, thereâ€™s a lot of sour too from the vinegar and mustard so it balances it out.

This Honey Mustard Dressing keeps for weeks in the fridge so itâ€™s a fantastic one to make a big batch of to have one hand for quick salads, both side salads and more substantial meal salads! **_â€“ Nagi x_**

Creamy, tangy with a touch of sweet. A true crowd pleaser, use for leafy greens and roasted vegetables. It goes fantastic with my [Roasted Sweet Potato Salad](https://www.recipetineats.com/roasted-sweet-potato-salad-honey-lemon-dressing/)!

#### Big Batch to Keep (1 cup)

- â–¢ 1/4 cup Dijon mustard
- â–¢ 1/4 cup honey
- â–¢ 1/4 cup cider vinegar
- â–¢ 1/4 cup vegetable or olive oil
- â–¢ 1 tsp salt
- â–¢ Black pepper

#### Single side salad batch (makes 1/3 cup, enough for a side salad for 4 ppl)

- â–¢ 1 1/2 tbsp Dijon mustard
- â–¢ 1 1/2 tbsp honey
- â–¢ 1 1/2 tbsp cider vinegar
- â–¢ 1 1/2 tbsp vegetable or olive oil
- â–¢ 1/4 tsp salt
- â–¢ Black pepper

- Place ingredients in a jar and shake well until you can't see any honey on the base of the jar. Adjust sweet (honey), sour (vinegar) and salt to taste.
- Keep for 3 weeks in the fridge in an airtight jar. (As long as the shelf life of your ingredients is greater than 3 weeks).
- Single side salad: Drizzle over 4 big handfuls of leafy greens and other salad of choice.

1\. You might think 1 tsp of salt is a lot but this dressing needs it because of the intensity of the flavours of the ingredients. And also once the dressing is drizzled over salad and tossed, the salt per serving is actually very little.
