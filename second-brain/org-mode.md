# Org Mode

A [[emacs-major-mode]] for keeping notes, authoring documents, computational
notebooks, [[literate-programming]], maintaining to-do lists, planning projects,
and more in a fast and effective plain text system similar to [[markdown]]

Org uses single characters to markup **bold** _italic_, \_underline\*, `code` and
=verbatim=. Links also use minimal markup in . :tag:
Org has more syntax, but what is shown here is enought to get started!

\*\* Blocks

With just a few keystrokes, it is possible to insert empty structural blocks,
such as ‘#+BEGIN_SRC’ … ‘#+END_SRC’, or to wrap existing text in such a block.

\*\* properties

Properties are key-value pairs associated with an entry. They live in a special
drawer with the name ‘PROPERTIES’. Each property is specified on a single line,
with the key (surrounded by colons) first, and the value after it:

#+begin_example
:PROPERTIES:
:Title: Goldberg Variations
:Composer: J.S. Bach
:Publisher: Deutsche Grammophon
:NDisks: 0
:END:
#+end_example

~C-c C-x p~ Set a property. This prompts for a property name and a value.
~C-c C-c d~ Remove a property from the current entry.
