What is it? TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source library for developing, training, and deploying deep learning models. 

Background: TensorFlow was originally released in 2015 by Google Brain. Originally, its front end wasnâ€™t user friendly, and it had redundant APIs that made building and implementing models cumbersome. Many of these issues have been resolved over time with updates, as well as by integrating Keras (see below) as the default front end. 

Features: TensorFlow has numerous packages for building deep learning models and scaling them for commercial deployment. 

TensorFlow users can call upon the hundreds of pre-trained models in the [Dev Hub](https://www.kaggle.com/models?tfhub-redirect=true) and [Model Garden](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official). The Dev Hub contains plug-and-play models while the Model Garden is intended for more advanced users who are comfortable making customizations. 
It is efficient in its use of memory, making it possible to train multiple neural networks in parallel. 
TensorFlow applications can run on a wide variety of hardware systems, including CPUs, GPUs, TPUs, and more. 
TensorFlow Lite is optimized for mobile and embedded machine learning models.
Users can freely upload and share their machine learning experiments on Tensorboard.dev. 
Best for: Building production-ready deep learning models at scale.

Downsides: Some users still complain that the front-end is fairly complicated. You may also come across critiques that TensorFlow executes slowly. This is mostly a legacy complaint from TensorFlow 1.0, when it executed operations in graph mode by default. TensorFlow 2.0 defaults to eager execution mode.
