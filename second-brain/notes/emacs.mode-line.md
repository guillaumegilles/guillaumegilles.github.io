#+title: mode line

At the bottom of each window is a *mode line*, which describes what is going
on in the current buffer. When there is only one window, the mode line appears
right above the [echo area]; it is the next-to-last line in the frame.
On a graphical display, the mode line is drawn with a 3D box appearance.
Emacs also usually draws the mode line of the selected window with a different
color from that of unselected windows, in order to make it stand out.
