If you need to convert files from one markup format into another, pandoc is your
swiss-army knife. Pandoc understands a number of useful markdown syntax
extensions, including document metadata (title, author, date); footnotes;
tables; definition lists; superscript and subscript; strikeout; enhanced ordered
lists (start number and numbering style are significant); running example lists;
delimited code blocks with syntax highlighting; smart quotes, dashes, and
ellipses; markdown inside HTML blocks; and inline LaTeX. If strict markdown
compatibility is desired, all of these extensions can be turned off.
