## Learning with mental models

Learn to code is a difficult task, whatever one could say about it. It requires several qualities, such as dedication, eagerness to learn, and most of all, the desire to understand the language of machine. I imagine code as a foreign language, the type of journey you take when you want to discover a new culture, new people, and a new way of thinking. While coding you interact with your machine through a programing language and the machine respond in mostly error threw back at your face because it does not understand what you mean **funny line**. Finally, when the code executes and everything goes as you anticipating, it is a moment of _grace_.
