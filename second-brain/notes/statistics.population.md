Population : ensemble des **individus** (ou _unité statistique_) observé et soumis à une analyse statistique.

In [[statistics]], we generally want to study a population. You can think of a
population as a collection of persons, things, or objects under study. To study
the population, we select a [[statistics.sample]]. The idea of sampling is to
select a portion (or subset) of the larger population and study that portion
(the sample) to gain information about the population. Data are the result of
sampling from a population.
