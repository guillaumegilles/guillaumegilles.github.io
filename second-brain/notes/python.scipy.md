What is it: [SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/) is a Python library for scientific computing. It contains packages and modules for performing calculations that help scientists conduct or analyze experiments. 

Background: In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Python open source community began working on a collection of tools to meet the needs of the scientific community. In 2001, they released these tools as SciPy. The community remains active and is always updating and adding new features. 

Features: SciPy’s packages comprise a complete toolkit of mathematical techniques from calculus, linear algebra, statistics, probabilities, and more. 

Some of its most popular packages for data scientists are for interpolation, K-means testing, numerical integration, Fourier transforms, orthogonal distance regression, and optimization.
SciPy also includes packages for image processing and signal processing. 
The Weave feature allows users to write code in C/C++ within Python. 
Best for: SciPy is a data scientist’s best friend. 

Downsides: Some users have found SciPy’s documentation lacking and critique several of its packages as inferior to similar packages found in MatLab.
