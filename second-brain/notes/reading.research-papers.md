- Advices for reading research papers by Andrew Ng

According to [[https://www.andrewng.org/][Andrew Ng]],

## Compile a list of papers

The first step to understand a subject is to _compile_ a list of ressource
material such as research papers, medium and/or blog posts, github repo, etc. At
that early stage, We shouldn't care much about the /quality/ of each individual
materials, it would be refine in a second step. This step isn't an attempt to
collect all sources possible, but rather more a starting point. We should start
with, at least, 5 sources, then add more revelant sources at the second step.

## Skipping around the list

Ounce a preliminary list is constituated, we should read about 15-15 % of each
materials, meaning, the title, abstract and sub-title. At that stage, we can
eliminated irrevelant materials, select materials we should read more in depth,
and add more materials thank to references, sources, bibliography, etc.

\*\* How to read a paper

Let's start by the wrong way to read a papers : 1st word to the the last!
Actually, we should multiples passes :

1. read the title, abstract, and figures ;
2. read more carefully introduction, conclusion, and figures ;
3. read the entire paper but skim the math ;
   4 read the whole thing but skip parts that doesn't make sense.

It is important to keep in mind severals questions while reading a paper :

1. Why did the authors try to accomplish ?
2. what are the key elements ?
3. What can we use ourselves ?
4. What other references so you want to follow ?

\*\* General Advices

\*\*\* An idea of the volume of reading materials

1. 5-20 papers to get a _basic understanding_ of a body of literature ;
2. 50 - 100 papers to get a _very good understang_

\*\*\* Different sources of materials

- [[https://icml.cc/][International Conference on Machine Learning]]
- [[https://iclr.cc/][International Conference on Learning Representations]]
- [[https://distill.pub/][Distill]]
- [[https://arxiv.org/][arXiv]]

\*\*\* How to understand the math and code in papers

Read through it while writing detailed notes. Then _re-derive it from scratch_ !
This is like art student in museums copying master's works.
Math and code can also be lean and understand by deciphire "master" works.
