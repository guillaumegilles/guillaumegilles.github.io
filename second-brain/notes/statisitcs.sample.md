Échantillon : sous ensemble de la population observée, le nombre d’individu est appelé la **taille de l’échantillon**.

In [[statistics]], we generally want to study a [[statistics.population]]. You
can think of a population as a collection of persons, things, or objects under
study. To study the population, we select a sample. The idea of sampling is to
select a portion (or subset) of the larger population and study that portion
(the sample) to gain information about the population. Data are the result of
sampling from a population.
