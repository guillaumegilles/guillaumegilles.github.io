POSSE has 2 main problems:

1. How are we consolidatiing comments, _likes_, etc. on other platforms to the central hub of POSSE, our own website.
2. Platforms shares code of conduct, different communities, _ethics_: is it possible to syndicate everywhere

Today, there isn’t solution to these problems because platforms keep themselves isolited. Platform’s design is well curated to keep people on platforms to increase engagements. Basically, it’s the oppossite of POSSE philosophy. [@piercePosterGuideInternet2023]
