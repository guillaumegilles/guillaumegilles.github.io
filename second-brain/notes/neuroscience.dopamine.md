> Yes, dopamine is released by rewarding stimuli like chocolate or sugar. But it‚Äôs also released by aversive stimuli like stress or pain. It fires when things are new or different, whether they‚Äôre good or bad. And in that way, dopamine is critical for helping you learn.

> Drugs basically continue to push dopamine even when things are no longer new or different. The brain continues to think that something is important, signaling you to keep paying attention. But while drugs increase dopamine in the moment, long-term drug use depletes it. So with more and more drug use, there‚Äôs less and less dopamine in the brain, which means you have a hard time learning anything new.

> Understanding dopamine as a molecule that guides how effectively we learn is much more accurate.

La dopamine est relach√©e dans le corps lorsque quelque chose de nouveau ou de diff√©rent appara√Æt. Dans ce sens, il est une pi√®ce indispensable pour le m√©canisme de l'apprentissage. @saplakogluSheStudiesHow2023
