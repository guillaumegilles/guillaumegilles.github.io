Since `extension.json` only for workspace, there is a CLI tool to manage extension, [Automatically install extension in vscode with CLI](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_command-line-extension-management)

- [Extension API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api)
- [Yo Code - Extension and Customization Generator](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-generator-code)

## [Workspace recommended extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_workspace-recommended-extensions)

Ctrl + shift + P => Extensions: Configure Recommended Extensions (Workspace Folder)
