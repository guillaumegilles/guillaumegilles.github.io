A Visual Studio Code "[workspace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspaces)"
is the collection of one or more folders thatare opened in a VS Code window
(instance).

The concept of a workspace enables VS Code to:

- Configure settings that only apply to a specific folder or folders but not
  others.
- Persist task and debugger launch configurations that are only valid in the
  context of that workspace.
- Store and restore UI state associated with that workspace (for example, the
  files that are opened).
- Selectively enable or disable extensions only for that workspace.
