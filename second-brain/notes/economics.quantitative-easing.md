** what is quantitative easing?

quantitative easing (QE) is a form of monetary policy in which a central bank,
like the U.S. Federal Reserve, purchases securities from the open market to
*reduce interest rates* and *increase the money supply*.

** key takeaways

1) QE is a form of monetary policy used by central banks to increase the
domestic money supply and spur economic activity.
2) In QE, the central bank purchases government bonds and other financial
instruments, such as mortgage-backed securities (MBS).
3) Quantitive easing is typically implemented when interest rates are near
zero and economic growth is stalled.
4) In the United States, the Federal Reserve implements quantitative easing
policies.
5) QE for the U.S. Federal Reserve, and asset purchase program (APP) for the
ECB.

** is QE printing money?

Critics have argued that quantitative easing is effectively a form of money
printing and point to examples in history where money printing has led to
*hyperinflation*. However, proponents of quantitative easing claim that banks
act as intermediaries rather than placing cash directly in the hands of
individuals and businesses so quantitative easing carries less risk of
producing runaway inflation.
