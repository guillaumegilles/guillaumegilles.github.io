## What is CUDA

CUDA is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) that allows software to use certain types of graphics processing units (GPUs) for general-purpose processing, an approach called general-purpose computing on GPUs (GPGPU). CUDA is a software layer that gives direct access to the GPU's virtual instruction set and parallel computational elements for the execution of compute kernels.[^1]
