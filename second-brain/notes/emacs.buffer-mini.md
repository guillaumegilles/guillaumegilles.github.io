The minibuffer is where Emacs commands read complicated arguments, such as file
names, buffer names, Emacs command names, or Lisp expressions. We call it the
“minibuffer” because it’s a special-purpose buffer with a small amount of
screen space. You can use the usual Emacs editing commands in the minibuffer to
edit the argument text.
