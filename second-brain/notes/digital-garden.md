Digital garden roots date back to 1998, when [Mark Bernstein](https://www.markbernstein.org/)
introduced the idea of the “hypertext garden” arguing for spaces on the internet
that let a person wade into the unknown. "Quiet spaces they can call their own".
A digital garden is rather different than a [[internet.blog]]. "With blogging,
you’re talking to a large audience [...] with digital gardening, you’re talking
to yourself. You focus on what you want to cultivate over time.”
