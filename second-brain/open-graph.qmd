The Open Graph protocol enables any [web page](website.qmd) to become a rich
object in a social graph. It will improve the previews of your content when a
link to it is pasted into applications like Slack, Discord, Facebook, Linkedin,
and more. For instance, this is used on Facebook to allow any web page to have
the same functionality as any other object on Facebook.

While many different technologies and schemas exist and could be combined
together, there isn't a single technology which provides enough information to
richly represent any web page within the social graph. The Open Graph protocol
builds on these existing technologies and gives developers one thing to
implement. Developer simplicity is a key goal of the Open Graph protocol which
has informed many of the technical design decisions.
