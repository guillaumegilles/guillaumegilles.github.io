# [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)

GitHub Flavored Markdown, often shortened as GFM, is the dialect of [[markdown]]
that is currently supported for user content on [GitHub](https://github.com/)

This formal specification, based on the [[commonmark]] Spec, defines the syntax
and semantics of this dialect. GFM is a strict superset of CommonMark. All the
features which are supported in GitHub user content and that are not specified
on the original CommonMark Spec are hence known as extensions, and highlighted
as such.

While GFM supports a wide range of inputs, itâ€™s worth noting that GitHub.com
perform additional post-processing and sanitization after GFM is converted to
HTML to ensure security and consistency of the website.
