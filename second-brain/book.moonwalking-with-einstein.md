chapter 6

After his succes on Ed's to-do list, Joshua is full of ambition. Every sticky notes are replaced by mental list in the purpose to train his brain, but this new ability can be used for something greater, like memorizing poems. Humain memroy isn't wired to retain phrases. There is two types for text retaintion. First, _memoria rerum_ consost of retainning key moment of the story. The other option, _memoria verborum_ aim to memorize every word.

Even the most famous poems, Odysse and Illiade of Homer, some rumors says that in reality it is a collections of poem transmitted oraly from barde to barde before getting written down.

Chapter 7: THe end of remembering

Socrate never written down his thoughts and ideas, not because he thought it was useless, but mostly because wirting in ancient greeck was very different of today writing. spaces, ponctuations, did not exist adn a text was no more than a long string of characters on majuscule. To extract ideas from a text, one should read the entire text and there were no index, table of content.

The writing style we considered for garanted is, actually, a slow evolution that started in the Middle Age. Books and texts becames a mean to externalize one's thoughts and ideas only thank to Gutenberg invention and the improvment of writing style which came with it.

chapter 8: The OK plateau

In 1960, two spychologist identified 3 steps of learning.

1. Cognitive stage: knowledges and skills are developping with numerus mistakes;
2. Associative stage knowledges and skills, from the first step, are consolidated together, and mistakes are becoming fewer (This step is exactly what [[zettelkasten|luhmann's system is]])
3. Autonomous stage: executing doesn't required thought process anymore, they can be applied in "auto-pilot" mode freeing cognitive space for other tasks.

In this last stage, an "OK plateau" might appear because there is no more cognitive effort in the process that is required to improve capacities. This level of capacity could be enought for most cases, but if one wants to be at the top of a subject, one has to stay in phase 1. In this level of inconfort, limits are push to surpass this plateau.

chapter 9: the talented tenth

"It takes knowledge to gain knowledges".

Abilities to remember or the quantity of stuff memoriezed by someone doesn't represent her intelligence, but it is a foundation to build on to increase one's intellect. Therefore, both memories and intelligence are link and interconnected. Someone whodesire to increase his intelligence, first needs to improve his memory capacity.

Today, more and more techniques are discovered, with the help of cognitive science. tony Buzan who created the world championship of memory developped a note taking technique, [[mind mapping]].
