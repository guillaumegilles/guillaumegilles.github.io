# Different notes in zettelkasten

The [[Zettelkasten]] system is based on 3 different notes:

1. **Permanent notes**: they are the long-term added value of the system.
   These notes benefit from the [[zettelkasten-numerotation]] system.
2. **Fleeting notes**: to capture thoughts, ideas, etc. that can go through
   your head. They are not intended to be kept. Conversely they must be refined
   every day.
3. **Literary notes**: to gather informations about the materials used to write
   _permanent notes_.
