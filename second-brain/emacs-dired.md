# [Emacs Dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired-Enter.html)

dired makes an [[emacs-buffer]] containing a listing of a directory, and
optionally some of its subdirectories as well. You can use the normal Emacs
commands to move around in this buffer, and special dired commands to operate on
the listed files. dired works with both local and remote directories.

To invoke Dired, type `C-x d` (dired). This reads a directoryâ€™s name using the
[[emacs-minibuffer]], and opens a dired buffer listing the files in that
directory.

You can also supply a wildcard file name pattern as the minibuffer argument, in
which case the Dired buffer lists all files matching that pattern. A wildcard
may appear in the directory part as well. For instance:

- `C-x d  ~/foo/*.el  RET`
- `C-x d  ~/foo/*/*.el  RET`
