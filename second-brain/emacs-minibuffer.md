# [Emacs Minibuffer](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Minibuffer.html)

The minibuffer is where [[emacs]] commands read complicated arguments, such as
file names, buffer names, Emacs command names, or Lisp expressions. We call it
the “minibuffer” because it’s a special-purpose buffer with a small amount of
screen space. You can use the usual Emacs editing commands in the minibuffer to
edit the argument text.
