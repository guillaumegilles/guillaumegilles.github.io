# Is statistics accurate?

One of the main concerns in the field of [[statistics]] is how accurately a
statistic estimates a [[statistical-parameter]]. The accuracy really depends on
how well the [[sample]] represents the [[statistical-population]]. The sample
must contain the characteristics of the population in order to be a
representative sample. We are interested in both the sample statistic and the
population parameter in [[inferential-statistics]].
