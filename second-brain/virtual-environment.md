A best practice among [[python]] developers is to use a project-specific `virtual environment`. Once you activate that environment, any packages you then install are isolated from other environments, including the global interpreter environment, reducing many complications that can arise from conflicting package versions. You can create non-global environments in VS Code using Venv or Anaconda with the [[vscode]] command `Python: Create Environment`.
