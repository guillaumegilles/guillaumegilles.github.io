# [Emacs Major Mode](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Major-Modes.html)

Every [[emacs-buffer]] possesses a _major mode_, which determines the editing
behavior of [[emacs]] while that buffer is current. The [[emacs-mode-line]]
shows the name of the current major mode. The least specialized major mode is
called **fundamental mode**. This mode has no mode-specific redefinitions or
variable settings, so that each Emacs command behaves in its most general manner,
and each user option variable is in its default state.

Most major modes fall into three major groups:

1. Modes for normal text, either plain or with mark-up, like [[org-mode]].
2. Modes for specific programming languages, [[python]], [[R]], etc.
3. Modes that are not associated directly with files; they are used in buffers
   created for specific purposes by Emacs, like [[emacs-dired]].
