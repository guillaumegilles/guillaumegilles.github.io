# [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)

At its core Emacs is an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the Lisp
programming language with extensions to support text editing. Now it is an
extensible, customizable, free/libre text editor â€” and more... much more!

## Configuration

The primary way to configure Emacs is to edit its configuration file which is
written in a language called Emacs Lisp. Here are the places where you might
find the main configuration file:

- `~/.emacs` or `~/.emacs.el` - the old location for the configuration file
  (not recommended!)
- `~/.emacs.d/init.el` - The main configuration file in the Emacs config folder
  (recommended on macOS and Windows)
- `~/.config/emacs/init.el` - Follows Linux desktop environment guidlines
  (recommended on Linux!)
