title: String in python
---

Strings in [[python]] are surrounded by either single quotation marks, `'`, or
double quotation marks `"`.

`'hello'` is the same as `"hello"`.

You can display a string literal with the [[python-print]] function:

```python
print("Let's go!")
```

## Escape characters

- `\n`: to print a new lign
- `\â€™`: `'Pluto\'s a planet'`
- `\"`
- `\\`
