## String in [[python]]

Strings are surrounded by either single quotation marks, `'`, or double
quotation marks `"`.

`'hello'` is the same as `"hello"`.

You can display a string literal with the [[python-print]] function:

```python
print("Let's go!")
```

Double quotes are convenient if your string contains a single quote character
(e.g. representing an apostrophe). Similarly, it's easy to create a string that
contains double-quotes if you wrap it in single quotes:

```python
print("Pluto's a planet!")
print('My dog is named "Pluto"')
```

## Escape characters with a backslash

| What you type | What you get | example                   | `print(example)`      |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `\'`          | `'`          | `'What\'s up?'`           | What's up?            |
| `\"`          | `"`          | `"That's \"cool\""`       | That's "cool"         |
| `\\`          | `\`          | `"Look, a mountain: /\\"` | Look, a mountain: /\  |
| `\n`          |              | `"1\n2 3"`                | 1                     |
|               |              |                           | 2 3                   |

## Strings are sequences

Strings can be thought of as sequences of characters. Almost everything we've
seen that we can do to a [[python-list]], we can also do to a string.

```python
planet = 'Pluto'

# Indexing
planet[0]

# Slicing
planet[-3:]

# How long is this string?
len(planet)

# Yes, we can even loop over them
[char+'! ' for char in planet]
```

But a **major** way in which they differ from lists is that they are **immutable**,
like a [[python-tuple]]. We can't modify them.

## String methods

Like [[python-list]], the type `str` has lots of very useful methods:

- [[python-upper]]
- [[python-lower]]
- [[python-index]]
- [[python-startswith]]
- [[python-endswith]]
