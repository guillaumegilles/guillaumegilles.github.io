In statistics and econometrics, _panel data_ and longitudinal data are both
multi-dimensional data involving measurements over time. Panel data is a subset
of longitudinal data where observations are for the same subjects each time.

Panel data is also a time based dataset.

The difference is that, in addition to time series, it also contains one or more
related variables that are measured for the same time periods.

Typically, the columns present in panel data contain explanatory variables that
can be helpful in predicting the Y, provided those columns will be available at
the future forecasting period.
