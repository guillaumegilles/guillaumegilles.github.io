Foam includes note templates! This allows you to easily create notes that have similar structure without having to use copy/paste :)

Templates support [[vscode]] the [VS Code's Snippet Syntax](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_snippet-syntax), which means you can:

- add variables to the newly created note
- add tabstop to automatically navigate to the key parts of the note, just like a form
  Below you can see an example showing a todo list and a timestamp.

## Todo List

1. ${1:First tabstop}
2. ${2:A second tabstop}
3. ${3:A third tabstop}

Note Created: ${CURRENT_YEAR}-${CURRENT_MONTH}-${CURRENT_DATE}

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[vscode]: vscode.md "VSCode / VSCodium"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
