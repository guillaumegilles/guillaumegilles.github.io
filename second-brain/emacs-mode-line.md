# [Emacs Mode Line](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Mode-Line.html)

At the bottom of each [[emacs-window]] is a _mode line_, which describes what is
going on in the current [[emacs-buffer]]. When there is only one window, the
mode line appears right above the [[emacs-echo-area]]; it is the next-to-last
line in the frame. On a graphical display, the mode line is drawn with a 3D box
appearance. [[emacs]] also usually draws the mode line of the selected window
with a different color from that of unselected windows, in order to make it
stand out.
