# [Emacs Buffer](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Buffers.html)

The text you are editing in [[emacs]] resides in an object called a _buffer_.
Each time you visit a file, a buffer is used to hold the file’s text. Each time
you invoke [[emacs-dired]], a buffer is used to hold the directory listing, etc.

Buffers exist as long as they are in use, and are deleted (“killed”) when no
longer needed, either by you (`C-x k RET`) or by Emacs when you exit Emacs.
