# Index of zettelkasten

The lack of structure in Luhmann's system requires robust keyword indexing to
provide ample opportunities for entry points into the notes. The objective of
the index is to mimic the functioning of the human brain thanks to an
exhaustive network of entry points with a few references (between 4 and 6). In
the case of the second _zettelkasten_ its index has 3,200 entries for 65,000
notes. Conversely, it is detrimental to have an index with few words and many
links. [@ImprovedTranslationCommunications2023]
