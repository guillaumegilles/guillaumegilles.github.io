# [Emacs Frame](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Frames.html)

In a [[gui]] emacs occupies a graphical system-level display region. It's what
we call nowadays, a "windows" and it's handled by the operating system. A frame
normally contains a [[emacs-window]], a menu bar, tool bar, and echo area.
