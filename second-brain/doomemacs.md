# Doomemacs

Doomemacs is a [[emacs]] distribution (flavor) configured to use Emacs out of
the box. To personalize Doomemacs, 3 files are accessible in `~/.doom.d`

1. `init.el`: to enable or disable Domemacs modules
2. `config.el`: private and custom configuration of Doomemacs
3. `packages.el`: install packages for Doomemacs on top of which we can already
   find in `./init.el` and `./config.el`

Doomemacs comes with several helpful [[bash]] [[doomemacs-commands]]

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[emacs]: emacs.md "Emacs"
[bash]: bash.md "Bash"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
