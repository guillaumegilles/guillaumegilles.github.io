# Quarto

An open-source scientific and technical publishing system

- Author using [[jupyter]] notebooks or with plain text markdown in your
  favorite editor.
- Create dynamic content with [[python]], [[r]], Julia, and Observable.
- Publish reproducible, production quality articles,
  [[quarto-revealjs]], dashboards, [[quarto-website]], blogs, and books in HTML,
  PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more.
- Share knowledge and insights organization-wide by publishing to Posit Connect,
  Confluence, or other publishing systems.
- Write using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) markdown, including equations,
  citations, crossrefs, figure panels, callouts, advanced layout, and more.

## How it works

When you render a `.qmd` file with Quarto, the executable code blocks are
processed by [[jupyter]], and the resulting combination of code, markdown, and
output is converted to plain markdown. Then, this markdown is processed by
[[pandoc]], which creates the finished format.

## [Markdown Basics in Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html)

Quarto is based on [[markdown-pandoc]] and uses its variation of markdown as its
underlying document syntax.

## Building Blocks of a Quarto Document

At the top of documents there is a [[quarto-yaml]] block with document level
options.
