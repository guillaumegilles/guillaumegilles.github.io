Daily notes allow you to quickly create and access a new notes file for each day.
This is a surpisingly effective and increasingly common strategy to organize
notes and manage events. View today's note file by running the 
`Foam: Open Daily Note` command.

## Roam-style Automatic Daily Notes

You can automatically open today's note on startup by setting the 
`Foam â€º Open Daily Note: On Startup` setting to `true`.

## Daily Note Templates

Daily notes can also make use of [notes template](foam-templates.qmd), by defining
a special `.foam/templates/daily-note.md` template.

## Configuration

By default, Daily Notes will be created in a file called `yyyy-mm-dd.md` in the
workspace's `journals` folder, with a heading `yyyy-mm-dd`. These settings can
be overridden in your workspace or global `.vscode/settings.json` file, using
the [**dateformat** date masking syntax](https://github.com/felixge/node-dateformat#mask-options):

```json
  "foam.openDailyNote.directory": "journal",
  "foam.openDailyNote.filenameFormat": "'daily-note'-yyyy-mm-dd",
  "foam.openDailyNote.fileExtension": "mdx",
  "foam.openDailyNote.titleFormat": "'Journal Entry, ' dddd, mmmm d",
```

The above configuration would create a file `journal/daily-note-2020-07-25.mdx`,
with the heading `Journal Entry, Sunday, July 25`.

> NOTE: It is possible to set the filepath of a daily note according to the date
using the special [note metadata](foam-yaml.qmd) inside a [Foam template](foam-templates.qmd).
Using the template property will override any setting configured through `.vscode/settings.json`.

## Snippets

Create a link to a recent daily note using [snippets](vscode-snippet.qmd). Type
`/today` and press `enter` to link to today's note. You can also write:

| Snippets      | Date          |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| `/tomorrow`  | tomorrow      |
| `/yesterday` | yesterday     |
| `/monday`    | next Monday   |
| `/+1d`       | tomorrow      |
| `/-3d`       | 3 days ago    |
| `/+1w`       | in a week     |
| `/-1m`       | one month ago |
| `/+1y`       | in one year   |
