1. Need to have navbar properties inside references. so only book + website :
  - website: https://quarto.org/docs/reference/projects/websites.html#navbar
  - book: https://quarto.org/docs/reference/projects/books.html#navbar

2. render sub project
  2.1 render entire website
  except subfolder https://quarto.org/docs/websites/index.html#render-targets
  _strategic-qsfsqdfqs


What I wanted:
standalone github repo w/ github-page: OK
integrated into an overall website: OK

using teaching-listing.yml for listing properties inside teaching.qmd

## Setps

1. `quarto render` projects and teaching
2. make sure `_quarto.yml` sub-projects information take into consideration the website `docs` directory hierarchy. `../../about.html` jump 2 levels, from specific projects to teaching level, then to root level of website.

```yml
  # Navbar
  navbar:
    logo: ../../images/cat.png
    title: false
    right:
      - text: ABOUT
        href: ../../about.html
      - text: PROJECTS
        href: ../../projects.html
      - text: TEACHING
        href: ../../teaching.html
      - text: BLOG
        href: ../../blog.html
```

2. `quarto render` website
3. Moving each `docs/` sub-projects into websiteâ€™s `docs/teaching` or `docs/projects` directories (since each render of the website wipes out the `docs/` directory).
  - rename appropriately from `docs/` to `description-donnees` for example.
