## Puzzle

You are a frog in a pond with four lily pads, marked ‚Äú`1`‚Äù through ‚Äú`4`‚Äù. You are currently on pad `2`, and your goal is to make it to pad `1`. From any given pad, there are specific probabilities that you‚Äôll jump to another pad:

- Once on pad `1`, you will happily stay there forever.
- From pad `2`, there‚Äôs a 1-in-2 chance you‚Äôll hop to pad `1`, and a 1-in-2 chance you‚Äôll hop to pad `3`.
- From pad `3`, there‚Äôs a 1-in-3 chance you‚Äôll hop to pad `2`, and a 2-in-3 chance you‚Äôll hop to pad `4`.
- Once on pad `4`, you will unhappily stay there forever.

Given that you are starting on pad `2`, **what is the probability that you will ultimately make it to pad `1`** (as opposed to pad 4)?

### Solution

This puzzle can be solved using **Markov chains**.

```{mermaid}
graph LR
  A((Pad 1))
  style A fill:#9DC183
  B((Pad 2)) -- 1/2 --> A
  style B fill:#9DC183
  C((Pad 3)) -- 2/3 --> D((Pad 4))
  style C fill:#9DC183
  style D fill:#9DC183
  C -- 1/3 --> B
  B -- 1/2 --> C
  D -- 1 --> D
  A -- 1 --> A
```

Pads `1` and `4` are absorbing states (once you reach them, you stay there forever), while pads `2` and `3` are transient states (you can leave them). Let‚Äôs define:

- $P_2$: the probability of eventually reaching pad `1` starting from pad `2`.
- $P_3$: the probability of eventually reaching pad `1` starting from pad `3`.

#### Step 1: Probability equations

Starting from pad `2`, there is an equal $\frac{1}{2}$ chance of jumping to pad `1` or pad `3`:

- If the frog jumps to pad `1`, the journey is complete, so the contribution to $P_1$ is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 1$.
- If the frog jumps to pad `3`, the probability of eventually reaching pad `1` depends on $P_3$, with a contribution of $\frac{1}{2} \cdot P_3$.

Thus:
$$
P_2 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot P_3.
$$

From pad `3`, the frog has a $\frac{1}{3}$ chance of hopping back to pad `2`, where the probability of reaching pad `1` is $P_2$. If the frog instead jumps to pad `4` (with probability $\frac{2}{3}$), the probability of reaching pad `1` is $0$.

Therefore:
$$
P_3 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot P_2.
$$

#### Step 2: Solve for $P_2$

Substitute $P_3 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot P_2$ into the equation for $P_2$:
$$
P_2 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \cdot P_2 \right).
$$

Simplify:
$$
P_2 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} \cdot P_2.
$$

Rearrange to isolate $P_2$:
$$
P_2 \cdot \left( 1 - \frac{1}{6} \right) = \frac{1}{2}.
$$

$$
P_2 \cdot \frac{5}{6} = \frac{1}{2}.
$$

Solve for $P_2$:
$$
P_2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{6}{5}.
$$

$$
P_2 = \frac{3}{5}.
$$

The probability of eventually reaching pad `1` starting from pad `2` is:
$$
\frac{3}{5}
$$

## Extra Credit

Once again, you are a frog in a pond. But this time, the pond has infinitely many lily pads, which are numbered ‚Äú`1`,‚Äù ‚Äú`2`,‚Äù ‚Äú`3`,‚Äù etc. As before, you are currently on pad `2`, and your goal is to make it to pad `1`, which you would happily stay on forever.

Whenever you are on pad `k`, you will hop to pad $k‚àí1$ with probability $\frac{1}{k}$, and you will hop to pad $k+1$ with probability $\frac{(k‚àí1)}{k}$.

Now, **what is the probability that you will ultimately make it to pad `1`?**
