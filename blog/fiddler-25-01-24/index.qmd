## Puzzle

You are a frog in a pond with four lily pads, marked “1” through “4”. You are currently on pad 2, and your goal is to make it to pad 1. From any given pad, there are specific probabilities that you’ll jump to another pad:

- Once on pad 1, you will happily stay there forever.
- From pad 2, there’s a 1-in-2 chance you’ll hop to pad 1, and a 1-in-2 chance you’ll hop to pad 3.
- From pad 3, there’s a 1-in-3 chance you’ll hop to pad 2, and a 2-in-3 chance you’ll hop to pad 4.
- Once on pad 4, you will unhappily stay there forever.

Given that you are starting on pad 2, what is the probability that you will ultimately make it to pad 1 (as opposed to pad 4)?

### Solution

This puzzle can be solved using **Markov chains** .

```{mermaid}
graph LR
  A((Pad 1))
  style A fill:#509439
  B((Pad 2)) -- 1/2 --> A
  style B fill:#509439
  C((Pad 3)) -- 2/3 --> D((Pad 4))
  style C fill:#509439
  style D fill:#509439
  C -- 1/3 --> B
  B -- 1/2 --> C
  D -- 1 --> D
  A -- 1 --> A
```

Pads 1 and 4 are absorbing states (once you reach them, you stay there forever), while pads 2 and 3 are transient states (you can leave them). Let’s call $P_1$ the probability of reaching pad **1** from pad **2** and $P_2$ the probability of reaching pad **1** from pad **3**.

Starting from pad, you have equal chance ($\frac{1}{2}$) of reaching pads 1 or 3. If you land on pad 1: houra!, if not, therefore you land on pad 3. From pad 3, you only hope to jump back to pad 2, $1$ chance of 3, to start all oer again. So:

$$
P_1 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot P_2
$$

And:

$$
P_2 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot P_1
$$

Let’s plug $P_2 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot P_1$ into $P_1$:

$$
P_1 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot (\frac{1}{3} \cdot P_1)
$$

$$
P_1 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} \cdot P_1
$$

$$
P_1 \cdot (1 - \frac{1}{6}) = \frac{1}{2}
$$

$$
P_1 \cdot \frac{5}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

$$
P_1 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{6}{5}
$$

$$
P_1 = \frac{3}{5}
$$

## Extra Credit

Once again, you are a frog in a pond. But this time, the pond has infinitely many lily pads, which are numbered “1,” “2,” “3,” etc. As before, you are currently on pad 2, and your goal is to make it to pad 1, which you would happily stay on forever.

Whenever you are on pad k, you will hop to pad $k−1$ with probability $\frac{1}{k}$, and you will hop to pad $k+1$ with probability $\frac{(k−1)}{k}$.

Now, what is the probability that you will ultimately make it to pad 1?
