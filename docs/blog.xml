<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking to create a blog for a while now, but never crossed the line to actually setting one up and running. I think the desire to have a place of my own to talk about thing that resonnate to me and pet projects I am working on have been stronger than the fear of being judged.</p>
<p>As an aspirying machine learning engineer, blog posts are great opportunities to showcase:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Examples that convinced me of a candidate’s expertise in certain technology […] a blog post that covers in-depth detail about X that made our team go: “Whoa, they really know about X.” <span class="citation" data-cites="huyenWhatWeLook2023">(Huyen 2023)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://varianceexplained.org/about/">David Robinson</a>’s best advice for someone wanted to start a data science career is to start a <a href="http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/">blog</a>. In his post, he explained his three key opinions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Practice analyzing data and communicating about it</strong>: it can be easily resumed to “practice makes perfect” or in French: “C’est en forgeant qu’on devient forgeron”.</li>
<li><strong>Create a portfolio of your work and skills</strong>: after spending hours and nights practicing your data science craft, a blog is a valuable medium to share your work. This piece of advice works well for established data scientists as well.</li>
<li><strong>Get feedback and evaluation</strong>: creating a community and interacting with an audience helps individuals to reach for better.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://quarto.org">Quarto</a> have reduced the friction of building a website so low that it would be a shame to miss this opportunity. So let’s start building my digital garden.</p>
