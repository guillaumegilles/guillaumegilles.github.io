<section id="statistics" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="statistics">Statistics</h2>
<p>The science of <strong>statistics</strong> deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. We see and use data in our everyday lives.</p>
<p>In this course, you will learn how to organize and summarize data. Organizing and summarizing data is called <strong>descriptive statistics</strong>. Two ways to summarize data are by graphing and by using numbers (for example, finding an average). After you have studied probability and probability distributions, you will use formal methods for drawing conclusions from “good” data. The formal methods are called <strong>inferential statistics</strong>. Statistical inference uses probability to determine how confident we can be that our conclusions are correct.</p>
<p>Effective interpretation of data (inference) is based on good procedures for producing data and thoughtful examination of the data. You will encounter what will seem to be too many mathematical formulas for interpreting data. The goal of statistics is not to perform numerous calculations using the formulas, but to gain an understanding of your data. The calculations can be done using a calculator or a computer. The understanding must come from you. If you can thoroughly grasp the basics of statistics, you can be more confident in the decisions you make in life.</p>
</section>
<section id="probability" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="probability">Probability</h2>
<p><strong>Probability</strong> is a mathematical tool used to study randomness. It deals with the chance (the likelihood) of an event occurring. For example, if you toss a fair coin four times, the outcomes may not be two heads and two tails. However, if you toss the same coin 4,000 times, the outcomes will be close to half heads and half tails. The expected theoretical probability of heads in any one toss is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D"> or <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.5">. Even though the outcomes of a few repetitions are uncertain, there is a regular pattern of outcomes when there are many repetitions.</p>
<p>The theory of probability began with the study of games of chance such as poker. Predictions take the form of probabilities. To predict the likelihood of an earthquake, of rain, we use probabilities. Doctors use probability to determine the chance of a vaccination causing the disease the vaccination is supposed to prevent. A stockbroker uses probability to determine the rate of return on a client’s investments. You might use probability to decide to buy a lottery ticket or not. In your study of statistics, you will use the power of mathematics through probability calculations to analyze and interpret your data.</p>

<section id="key-terms" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-terms">Key Terms</h2>
<p>In statistics, we generally want to study a <strong>population</strong>. You can think of a population as a collection of persons, things, or objects under study. To study the population, we select a <strong>sample</strong>. The idea of <strong>sampling</strong> is to select a portion (or subset) of the larger population and study that portion (the sample) to gain information about the population. Data are the result of sampling from a population.</p>
<p>Because it takes a lot of time and money to examine an entire population, sampling is a very practical technique. If you wished to compute the overall grade point average at your school, it would make sense to select a sample of students who attend the school. The data collected from the sample would be the students’ grade point averages. In presidential elections, opinion poll samples of 1,000–2,000 people are taken. The opinion poll is supposed to represent the views of the people in the entire country. Manufacturers of canned carbonated drinks take samples to determine if a 16 ounce can contains 16 ounces of carbonated drink.</p>
<p>From the sample data, we can calculate a <strong>statistic</strong>. A statistic is a number that represents a property of the sample. For example, if we consider one math class to be a sample of the population of all math classes, then the average number of points earned by students in that one math class at the end of the term is an example of a statistic. The statistic is an estimate of a population <strong>parameter</strong>, in this case the mean. A parameter is a numerical characteristic of the whole population that can be estimated by a statistic. Since we considered all math classes to be the population, then the average number of points earned per student over all the math classes is an example of a parameter.</p>

<div class="callout-title-container flex-fill">
Is statistics accurate?
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>One of the main concerns in the field of statistics is how accurately a statistic estimates a parameter. The accuracy really depends on how well the sample represents the population. The sample must contain the characteristics of the population in order to be a representative sample. We are interested in both the sample statistic and the population parameter in inferential statistics. In a later chapter, we will use the sample statistic to test the validity of the established population parameter.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>A <strong>variable</strong>, usually notated by capital letters such as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y">, is a characteristic or measurement that can be determined for each member of a population. Variables may be <strong>numerical</strong> or <strong>categorical</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Numerical variables take on values with equal units such as weight in pounds and time in hours.</li>
<li>Categorical variables place the person or thing into a category.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> equal the number of points earned by one math student at the end of a term, then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> is a numerical variable. If we let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y"> be a person’s party affiliation, then some examples of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y"> include Republican, Democrat, and Independent. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y"> is a categorical variable. We could do some math with values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> (calculate the average number of points earned, for example), but it makes no sense to do math with values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y"> (calculating an average party affiliation makes no sense).</p>
<p>Two words that come up often in statistics are <strong>mean</strong> and <strong>proportion</strong>. If you were to take three exams in your math classes and obtain scores of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?86">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?75">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?92">, you would calculate your mean score by adding the three exam scores and dividing by three (your mean score would be <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?84.3"> to one decimal place). If, in your math class, there are <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?40"> students and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?22"> are men and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?18"> are women, then the proportion of men students is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfrac%7B22%7D%7B40%7D"> and the proportion of women students is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfrac%7B18%7D%7B40%7D">. Mean and proportion are discussed in more detail in later chapters.</p>

Average or mean ?
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>The words “mean” and “average” are often used interchangeably. The substitution of one word for the other is common practice. The technical term is <code>arithmetic mean</code>, and “average” is technically a center location. However, in practice among non-statisticians, “average” is commonly accepted for <code>arithmetic mean</code>.</p>

<p>You are probably asking yourself the question, “When and where will I use statistics?” If you read any newspaper, watch television, check weather forecast or use the Internet, you will see statistical information. There are statistics about crime, sports, education, politics, and real estate. Typically, when you read a newspaper article or watch a television news program, you are given sample information. With this information, you may make a decision about the correctness of a statement, claim, or “fact.” Statistical methods can help you make the “best educated guess.” Since you will undoubtedly be given statistical information at some point in your life, you need to know some techniques for analyzing the information thoughtfully. Think about buying a house or managing a budget. Think about your chosen profession. The fields of economics, business, psychology, education, biology, law, computer science, police science, and early childhood development require at least one course in statistics.</p>

<p>TL;DR …</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking to create a website, and more pricesly a blog, for a while now. I’ve never crossed the line of hypothesis until now, by fear of being judged. Expressing one’s thoughts on the web is intimidating and daunting. But I supposed the desire to have a place of my own to talk about thing that resonnate to me and pet projects I am working on is a stronger driving force than lack of self confidence.</p>
<p>As an aspirying machine learning engineer, blog posts are great opportunities to showcase your work. According to Chip Huyen, it is a great place to demonstrate “examples that convinced me of a candidate’s expertise in certain technology […] a blog post that covers in-depth detail about X that made our team go: Whoa, they really know about X.” <span class="citation" data-cites="huyenWhatWeLook2023">(Huyen 2023)</span></p>
<p>For David Robinson, a blog is the best advice for someone wanted to start a data science career. It helps to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Practice analyzing data and communicating about it</strong>: it can be easily resumed to “practice makes perfect” or in French: “C’est en forgeant qu’on devient forgeron”.</li>
<li><strong>Create a portfolio of your work and skills</strong>: after spending hours and nights practicing your data science craft, a blog is a valuable medium to share your work. This piece of advice works well for established data scientists as well.</li>
<li><strong>Get feedback and evaluation</strong>: creating a community and interacting with an audience helps individuals to reach for better. <span class="citation" data-cites="robinsonAdviceAspiringData2017">(Robinson 2017)</span></li>
