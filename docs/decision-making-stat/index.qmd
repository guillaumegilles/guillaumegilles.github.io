## Calculation of probabilities 

![](../img/dice_map.jpg)

Practical approach: 
Probability allows to measure the likelihood of an event. 
Some definitions : 
Random experiment: an experiment (involving chance) whose results can not be predicted with certainty 
Universe: the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment, noted Ω 
Event: a part or subset of the universe

Probability: a number between 0 and 1 that gives a measure of the likelihood of an event. In other words, if 𝐸 is an event, then  

0 ≤ ℙ(𝐸) ≤ 1 
Special cases of events:
Certain event: it can be described with all the elements of Ω and in that case its probability is 1 
Impossible event: there exist no element of Ω which can describe it and in that case its probability is 0 


Properties and basic operations: 

Inclusion : 
𝐴 ⊂ 𝐵 ⇒ ℙ(𝐴) ≤ ℙ(𝐵) 
Intersection :
 ℙ(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵) ≤ ℙ(𝐵)  and  ℙ(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵) ≤ ℙ(𝐴) 
If ℙ(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵) = ℙ(𝐴) × ℙ(𝐵), then 𝐴 and 𝐵  are  two independent events
If  𝐴  and  𝐵  are disjoint (i.e.  𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 = ∅ ), then ℙ(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵) = 0

Union :
 ℙ (𝐴)≤ℙ(𝐴∪𝐵),    ℙ(𝐵) ≤ ℙ(𝐴∪𝐵)   and   ℙ(𝐴∩𝐵) ≤ ℙ(𝐴∪𝐵) 
 ℙ(𝐴 ∪ 𝐵)= ℙ(𝐴)+ ℙ(𝐵)− ℙ(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵)
	Therefore, if 𝐴 and 𝐵  are  two disjoint events, 
	then ℙ(𝐴 ∪ 𝐵) = ℙ(𝐴) + ℙ(𝐵) 
 The difference : 
 (𝐴\∖𝐵) ⊂ 𝐴 ⇒ ℙ(𝐴\∖𝐵) ≤ ℙ(𝐴) 
 ℙ(𝐴\∖𝐵) = ℙ(𝐴) − ℙ(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵) 
If 𝐴 and 𝐵  are  two disjoint events, then (𝐴\∖𝐵) = 𝐴. 
Therefore, one gets ℙ(𝐴\∖𝐵) = ℙ(𝐴). 

Complementarity : 
The complement of the event 𝐴 is an event (denoted 𝐴 ̅ or Ω\∖𝐴) that contains all elements of Ω not belonging to 𝐴 

$$P(\overline{A}) = 1 - P(A)$$

Equiprobability

Assume that the universe $\Omega$ of a random experiment is a finite set. We talk of equiprobability when all the possible outcomes of the experiment have the same probability (of realization). Let $A$ be an event associated with this experiment. In that case, we have:

$$P(𝐴) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable cases}}{\text{Number of possible cases}}$$

The conditional probability

Let $A$ and $B$, two events from the same universe $\Omega$. Suppose that $A$ is a non-zero probability event. We call **conditional probability** of $B$ such $A$ (or knowing that $A$ is realized) the quantity defined as follows:

$$P(B \vert A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}$$

In the same way, the conditional probability of $A$ such $B$ (or knowing that $B$ is realized) is defined by:

$$P(A \vert B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$

If $A$ and $B$ are two independent events, then:

$$P(A \vert B) = P(𝐴)$$

$$P(B \vert A) = P(B)$$

Total Probability Formula:

Let $\{𝐸1, ..., 𝐸_𝑘\}$ be a partition of $\Omega$ (such that  𝐸_𝑖  ≠ ∅ for all 𝑖 = 1,…,𝑘) 
Let 𝐵 be an event. We have : 

"ℙ" (𝐵)= ∑_(𝑖=1)^𝑘▒"ℙ" (𝐵∩𝐸_𝑖 )   
                  
                     =∑_(𝑖=1)^𝑘▒〖"ℙ" (𝐸_𝑖 )" ℙ" (𝐵 ┤| 𝐸_𝑖)〗

### Definition

A set is the mathematical model for a collection of different and distinct **things** / **objects** ; a set contains elements or members, which can be mathematical objects of any kind: numbers, symbols, points in space, lines, other geometrical shapes, variables, or even other sets. The set with no elements is the empty set; a set with a single element is a singleton. A set may have a finite number of elements or be an infinite set.

Definitions : 
A set 𝐸 is a collection of objects, called its elements, considered **without order** or **possible repetition** (parce que ce sont des objets). 
If " 𝑥 is an element of the set 𝐸 ", then one can say that "𝑥 belongs to 𝐸 " and we denote 𝑥 ∈ 𝐸 
A set without element is called empty set: notation: ∅ 
A single-element set is called a singleton 
A two-element set, is called a pair 
A subset is a part of the set 

### How to represent a set

Representation of a set :
By extension: give an exhaustive list of all its elements. 
By understanding: give a characteristic property of its elements.
For example : 
𝐴 = {𝑥 ∈ℕ ┤|  x is an even number}  by extension : 𝐴 = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8,…}
𝐵 = {𝑥 ∈ℤ | −2 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 5}   by extension : 𝐵 = {−2,−1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

### Usual sets in mathematics

Usual sets in mathematics :
ℕ" = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .}  "the set of nonnegative integers
ℤ" = {..., −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, ...}"  the set of integers 
ℚ={ 𝑎/𝑏, 𝑎∈ℤ, 𝑏∈ℤ, and 𝑏≠0} the set of rational numbers (the fractions)
ℝ "= ]−∞, +∞[ " the set of real numbers
ℝ "\ "{𝑎} the set of all the real numbers in ℝ except 𝑎
ℝ^+ "= [0, +∞["  the set of positif real numbers
ℝ^− "= ]−∞, 0]" the set of negatif real numbers 

### Operations on sets

Operations on Sets : 

#### Inclusion : 𝐴 ⊂ 𝐵 : 
∀ 𝑥∈𝐴 ⇒ 𝑥∈𝐵 

#### Equality  : 𝐴 = 𝐵 
∀ 𝑥∈𝐴 ⟺𝑥∈𝐵

Note that 𝐴 ⊆ 𝐵 implies  " 𝐴 is included in 𝐵 or equal to 𝐵 ". 

Recall that :	   𝐴=𝐵 ⟺ 𝐴⊆𝐵  and  𝐵⊆𝐴. 

#### Intersection : 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵
∀ 𝑥 ∈ 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵⟺𝑥 ∈ 𝐴  and  𝑥 ∈ 𝐵. 

Recall that :
if 𝐴∩𝐵=∅, then one can say that  𝐴 and 𝐵 are disjoint 
𝐴∩𝐵 = 𝐵∩𝐴
𝐴∩∅ = ∅
𝐴∩(𝐵∩𝐶) = (𝐴∩𝐵)∩𝐶

#### Union : 𝐴∪𝐵
∀ 𝑥 ∈𝐴∪𝐵⟺𝑥 ∈ 𝐴   or  𝑥 ∈ 𝐵. 

	Recall that :
𝐴⊆(𝐴∪𝐵),𝐵⊆(𝐴∪𝐵),and 𝐴∩𝐵⊆(𝐴∪𝐵) 
𝐴∪𝐵=𝐵∪𝐴
𝐴∪∅=𝐴
𝐴∪(𝐵∪𝐶)=(𝐴∪𝐵)∪𝐶
𝐴∩(𝐵∪𝐶)=(𝐴∩𝐵)∪(𝐴∩𝐶)

#### Complementarity : Let 𝐴, 𝐵 and 𝐶 be three sets, such that 𝐴 ⊂ 𝐵 and  𝐶⊂ 𝐵. The complement of 𝐴 in 𝐵 is the set of elements of 𝐵 not belonging to 𝐴.
	Notation :  𝐴 ̅  (or 𝐴^𝑐, or 𝐵∖𝐴). 

Recall that :
A ∩ 𝐴 ̅ = ∅
A ∪ 𝐴 ̅ = B
((𝐴 ̅)) ̅ = A 
((𝐴∩𝐶)) ̅  = 𝐴 ̅ ∪ 𝐶 ̅  and  ((𝐴 ∪ 𝐶) ) ̅ = 𝐴 ̅  ∩ 𝐶 ̅
