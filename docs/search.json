A colophon may include the device logo  of a printer or publisher. Colophons are traditionally printed at the ends of books, but sometimes the same information appears elsewhere and many modern (post-1800) books bear this information on the title page or on the verso of the title leaf, which is sometimes called a biblio page or the copyright page.\n\n\nEXample\nColophon\nkottke.org is hosted by Arcustech and published using Movable Type.
