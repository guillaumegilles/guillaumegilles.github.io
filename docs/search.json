Pouvez-vous me citer une agence de notation ?\nQue signifie une cotation « à dire d’expert » ? Quelle est la différence avec le scoring ?\nCitez la « philosophie » d’analyse qui permet de justifier tous les retraiments de la Banque de France.\nQu’est-ce qu’une SCI : quelle est l’objectif d’une SCI et pourquoi doit-on y prêter une attention particulière ?\nComment définissez-vous le résultat net récurrent (RNR) ?\n\n\n\nApprofondissement du sujet (3 points) :\nLes questions suivantes n’ont pas été abordé pendant le cours. Vous devez faire vos propres recherches et rédiger vos réponses en fonction des notions vues ensemble :\n\nQu’est-ce qu’un SPAC ?\nÉnumérer les différentes formes d’analyse financière et les comparer à celle étudier pendant les 2 jours.\n\n\n\nÉtude de cas (12 points) :\nAnalysez de façon critique et pensez à bien argumenter chacune de vos réponses.\n\nCompte tenu des informations suivantes, peut-on raisonner en endettement financier net ou brut ?\n\n\nL’organisation financière s’articule autour d’un cash pooling auprès de la Banque Populaire qui couvre l’ensemble des sociétés françaises ; il n’existe pas de frein à la circulation des flux.L’endettement financier est porté principalement par les différentes filiales portant des programmes d’investissements photovoltaïques. Le financement de ces projets est réalisé par fonds propres pour 15% et par dette bancaire pour 85% via des prêts bancaires avec une maturité de 19 ans. Il existe très peu de financement “corporate”.\n\n\nRéaliser la matrice SWOT en vous basant sur le compte-rendu d’entretien suivant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nLe groupe est un prestataire de services spécialisé dans la maintenance des systèmes électriques et électroniques. La vocation du groupe est donc de maintenir en condition opérationnelle les systèmes d’entrainement électroniques et électriques utilisés par ses clients industriels, ferroviaires et automobiles.\nSur son principal marché le concurrent du groupe est XYZ. La différenciation entre ces deux acteurs est la qualité. Le groupe est positionné sur une qualité “premium” avec un taux de réussite sur les réparations de 99% tandis que son concurrent XYZ possède un taux de réussite de ses réparations de 80%.La segmentation prix est donc différente, le prestation du groupe est plus onéreuse.\nLe groupe est implanté en France avec 11 sites spécialisés dans les servomoteurs, l’électronique et l’électrique ; en Allemagne , grâce à la croissance externe, depuis 2015 ; et finalement, en Chine où le groupe essaie de percer le marché chinois depuis plusieurs années.\nEn tant que réparateur indépendant, le groupe dispose de partenariats avec les plus grands fournisseurs d’appareils électriques, électroniques et servomoteurs afin d’être identifié par les clients comme un réparateur agréé de la marque. Ainsi, le groupe possède des partenariats avec Siemens (part de marché mondiale estimée à 40%), Fanuc (industriel japonais disposant d’une part de marché estimée de 20%) et Bosch (10% de part de marché estimée). Compte tenu de la prédominance d’acteurs allemands, il était donc important pour le groupe de s’implanter physiquement en Allemagne afin d’asseoir sa position de leader européen.\nLa stratégie du groupe repose sur deux axes de développement. Le premier est le renforcement de la position de leader sur les technologies à forte valeur ajoutée grâce à une constante innovation sur l’électronique et les servomoteurs. En effet, les dépenses de recherche & développement représentent chaque année 3% à 4% du chiffre d’affaires consolidé.\nLe second axe de développement est l’international, avec des acquisitions en Europe et des créations d’entités en Asie. L’objectif du groupe est d’atteindre une taille critique (50 M€ de chiffre d’affaires et 400 collaborateurs) afin de devenir un acteur européen incontournable.\nAfin que le groupe puisse se développer, la condition de marché “optimale” est une croissance du PIB comprise entre 1% et 2,5%. Dans cette fourchette, l’investissement industriel est partiel et les entreprises font plus appel à la maintenance qu’au renouvellement des immobilisations. Dans ces conditions, le ralentissement de la croissance en Chine apparaît comme opportun pour pénétrer le marché et s’imposer comme un acteur de référence dans un pays où le parc de robots et de circuits électroniques est le plus important du monde. Il représente un marché de 200 M€.\n\nChine :\nLe chiffre d’affaires est inférieur au budget prévisionnel en 2016, 2017 et 2018 à cause des difficultés pour pénétrer ce marché. Les projections actualisés de marge EBE sont de -500 K€ en 2016 et -700 K€ en 2017. La croissance en Chine reste un foyer de coût pour le groupe. Le point d’équilibre devrait être atteint au début de l’année 2020, voir 2021. Pour le moment, ce relais de croissance est amorti par les marges réalisées en Europe.\n\n\nStratégie :\nDans la recherche de marché à forte valeur ajoutée, le groupe cherche des relais de croissance dans l’industrie aéronautique et militaire avec pour commencer les bornes de test des rafales et les tourelles des chars français. Ce nouveau segment nécessite une certification GR23 que le groupe est en train d’obtenir. Avec ce débouché, le groupe espère conforter ses marges\n\n\n\n\nEn vous basant sur les comptes consolidés, disponible ici, calculez :\n\nLe résultat net récurrent ;\nLes fonds propres nets réduits ;\nLe taux d’endettement"

The set with no elements is the empty set; a set with a single element is a singleton. A set may have a finite number of elements or be an infinite set.\nDefinitions : A set 𝐸 is a collection of objects, called its elements, considered without order or possible repetition (parce que ce sont des objets). If ” 𝑥 is an element of the set 𝐸 “, then one can say that”𝑥 belongs to 𝐸 ” and we denote 𝑥 ∈ 𝐸 A set without element is called empty set: notation: ∅ A single-element set is called a singleton A two-element set, is called a pair A subset is a part of the set\n\n\n\nRepresentation of a set : By extension: give an exhaustive list of all its elements. By understanding: give a characteristic property of its elements. For example : 𝐴 = {𝑥 ∈ℕ ┤| x is an even number} by extension : 𝐴 = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8,…} 𝐵 = {𝑥 ∈ℤ | −2 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 5} by extension : 𝐵 = {−2,−1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\n\n\nDefinitions : A set 𝐸 is a collection of objects, called its elements, considered without order or possible repetition. If ” 𝑥 is an element of the set 𝐸 “, then one can say that”𝑥 belongs to 𝐸 ” and we denote 𝑥 ∈ 𝐸 A set without element is called empty set: notation: ∅ A single-element set is called a singleton A two-element set, is called a pair A subset is a part of the set\nUsual sets in mathematics : ℕ” = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .} “the set of nonnegative integers ℤ” = {…, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, …}” the set of integers ℚ={ 𝑎/𝑏, 𝑎∈ℤ, 𝑏∈ℤ, and 𝑏≠0} the set of rational numbers (the fractions) ℝ “= ]−∞, +∞[” the set of real numbers ℝ “ ”{𝑎} the set of all the real numbers in ℝ except 𝑎 ℝ^+ “= [0, +∞[” the set of positif real numbers ℝ^− ”= ]−∞, 0]” the set of negatif real numbers\nRepresentation of a set : By extension: give an exhaustive list of all its elements. By understanding: give a characteristic property of its elements. For example : 𝐴 = {𝑥 ∈ℕ ┤| x is an even number} by extension : 𝐴 = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8,…} 𝐵 = {𝑥 ∈ℤ | −2 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 5} by extension : 𝐵 = {−2,−1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nOperations on Sets : Inclusion : 𝐴 ⊂ 𝐵 : ∀ 𝑥∈𝐴 ⇒ 𝑥∈𝐵\nEquality : 𝐴 = 𝐵 ∀ 𝑥∈𝐴 ⟺𝑥∈𝐵\nNote that 𝐴 ⊆ 𝐵 implies ” 𝐴 is included in 𝐵 or equal to 𝐵 “.\nRecall that : 𝐴=𝐵 ⟺ 𝐴⊆𝐵 and 𝐵⊆𝐴.\nIntersection : 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 ∀ 𝑥 ∈ 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵⟺𝑥 ∈ 𝐴 and 𝑥 ∈ 𝐵.\nRecall that : if 𝐴∩𝐵=∅, then one can say that 𝐴 and 𝐵 are disjoint 𝐴∩𝐵 = 𝐵∩𝐴 𝐴∩∅ = ∅ 𝐴∩(𝐵∩𝐶) = (𝐴∩𝐵)∩𝐶\nUnion : 𝐴∪𝐵 ∀ 𝑥 ∈𝐴∪𝐵⟺𝑥 ∈ 𝐴 or 𝑥 ∈ 𝐵.\nRecall that :\n𝐴⊆(𝐴∪𝐵),𝐵⊆(𝐴∪𝐵),and 𝐴∩𝐵⊆(𝐴∪𝐵) 𝐴∪𝐵=𝐵∪𝐴 𝐴∪∅=𝐴 𝐴∪(𝐵∪𝐶)=(𝐴∪𝐵)∪𝐶 𝐴∩(𝐵∪𝐶)=(𝐴∩𝐵)∪(𝐴∩𝐶)\nComplementarity : Let 𝐴, 𝐵 and 𝐶 be three sets, such that 𝐴 ⊂ 𝐵 and 𝐶⊂ 𝐵. The complement of 𝐴 in 𝐵 is the set of elements of 𝐵 not belonging to 𝐴. Notation : 𝐴 ̅ (or 𝐴^𝑐, or 𝐵∖𝐴).\nRecall that : A ∩ 𝐴 ̅ = ∅ A ∪ 𝐴 ̅ = B ((𝐴 ̅)) ̅ = A ((𝐴∩𝐶)) ̅ = 𝐴 ̅ ∪ 𝐶 ̅ and ((𝐴 ∪ 𝐶) ) ̅ = 𝐴 ̅ ∩ 𝐶 ̅\nPartition :A partition of a set 𝐸 is a set of non-empty subsets of 𝐸 (called the components of the partition) which are disjoint such that their union is equal to 𝐸.\nExample : Suppose that 𝐸={1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}. Then : 𝐸={{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6, 7}} is a partition of 𝐸 ; 𝐸={{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6, 7}} is a partition of 𝐸 ; 𝐸={{1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}, {6}, {7}} is a partition of 𝐸 ; …\nSet of the parts:We call the set of the parts of 𝐴, the set of all the possible subsets of 𝐴. It is denoted 𝒫(𝐴).\nExemple : Suppose that 𝐴 = {1, 2, 3}. Then, we have: 𝒫(𝐴) = {∅, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}\nCardinal of a set :The cardinal is the size of a set. The cardinal of a finite set is the number of elements of the set. In particular, the cardinal of the empty set is zero. Notation : |𝐸| (or #(𝐸), or Card(𝐸)) is the cardinal of the set 𝐸\nRecall that if 𝐴⊆𝐵, then |𝐴|≤|𝐵|; if 𝐴⊆𝐵, then |𝐵|=|𝐵|−|𝐴|; if 𝐴∩𝐵=∅, then |𝐴∪𝐵|=|𝐴|+|𝐵|; |𝐴∪𝐵|=|𝐴|+|𝐵|−|𝐴∩𝐵|; if |𝐴|=𝑛, then |𝒫(𝐴)|=2^𝑛.\n\n\nThe purpose of combinatorial analysis (counting techniques) is to learn how to count the number of elements in a finite set.\nThree techniques will be addressed: Permutations Arrangements Combinations\nThese techniques depend on an operation: the factorial of a nonnegative integer.\nThe factorial :Let 𝑛 ∈ 𝑁. Its factorial is defined by :\n𝑛! = 1 × 2 × . . . × (𝑛 − 1) × 𝑛\nBy convention, we have 0! = 1. Main Property: Let 𝑘 be a nonnegative and non null integer (𝑘 ≥ 1) and let 𝑛 be a nonnegative and non null integer such that (𝑛−𝑘)≥0.\nWe have : 𝑛! = (𝑛 − 𝑘)! × (𝑛 − 𝑘 + 1) × . . . × (𝑛 − 1) × 𝑛.\nPermutations :Given a set 𝐸 of 𝑛 objects, a permutations is an ordered rearrangement, without repetition of these 𝑛 distinct objects. The number of permutations of 𝑛 objects equals 𝑛!\nArrangements : Given a set 𝐸 of 𝑛 objects (elements), we call arrangements of 𝑝 (1 ≤ 𝑝 ≤ 𝑛) objects, all ordered sequences of 𝑝 objects taken from the 𝑛 objects.\nThere are two cases:\nArrangements without repetition : When each object can only be seen once in an arrangement, the number of non-repeating arrangements of 𝑝 objects taken from 𝑛 is: 𝐴_𝑛^𝑝= 𝑛!/((𝑛−𝑝)!) where 1≤𝑝≤𝑛.\nArrangements with repetition : When an object can be observed several times in an arrangement, the number of arrangements with repetition of 𝑝 (1 ≤ 𝑝 ≤ 𝑛) objects taken from 𝑛 is equal to 𝑛^𝑝.\nRemark : The permutation of 𝑛 objects is a particular case of a non-repeating arrangement of 𝑝 objects taken from 𝑛 objects, when 𝑝 = 𝑛.\nThus, the number of permutations of 𝑛 objects equals :\n𝐴_𝑛^𝑛= 𝑛!/((𝑛−𝑛)!)=𝑛!/0!=𝑛!\nCombinations : Given a set 𝐸 of 𝑛 objects, we call combinations of 𝑝 (1 ≤ 𝑝 ≤ 𝑛) objects any set of 𝑝 objects taken  without replacement among the 𝑛 objects. In this case, the notion of order of objects is no longer taken into account. The number of combinations of 𝑝 objects taken from 𝑛 is\n𝐶_𝑛^𝑝= 𝑛!/(𝑝! × (𝑛−𝑝)!)=(𝐴_𝑛^𝑝)/𝑝!\n\n\n\nHow many 10-letter words can be formed with the 26 letters of the alphabet if the letters can be reused ?\nAt each position (1 to 10) one can chose among 26 different letters. Therefore the number of possibilities will be : 26 × 26 × 26 × 26 × 26 × 26 × 26 × 26 × 26 × 26= 2610.\nHow many 10-letter words can be formed with the 26 letters of the alphabet if each letter is used only once ?\nThe number of arrangements without repetition of 10 objects taken among 26 is equal to 𝐴_26^10 = 26!/((26 − 10)!) = 26 × 25 × 24 × 23 × 22 × 21 × 20 × 19 × 18 × 17 =19 275 223 968 000 words.\nHow many different numbers of 6 digits are there\nIf there are no restrictions? If the numbers have to be divisible by 5 ? If the repetition of digits is excluded?\nThe first digit cannot be 0 otherwise the number would have 5 digits\nWithout any restriction One gets 9 × 10 ×10 ×10 ×10 × 10 = 900 000 possible numbers\nIf the number ends by 0 or 5 (divisible by 5) One gets 9 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 2 = 180 000 possible numbers\nIf a chosen digit cannot be re-used One gets 9 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 = 136 080 possible numbers.\n\n\n\nA padlock has three wheels, each with the digits 0 to 9. How many secrets “numbers” are there?\nFrom a set of 52 cards, two cards are drawn simultaneously (without replacement). In how many different ways is this possible?\nThe code on your laptop is made up of 4 numbers (ranging from 0 to 9 each). A criminal has observed you doing the code. He managed to see only one number (but he doesn’t remember its position). What is the (maximum) number of tries for the criminal to unlock your laptop?\nThe number of possibilities is equal to 10 × 10 × 10 = 103 = 1000\nIt corresponds to the number of different ways you can choose a pair of cards from a deck of 52 cards, that is 𝐶_52^2 =1326\nFirst, the number of possible ways one can place the known digit is equal to 𝐶_4^1 =4 And then, the number of possibilities for the remaining three digits is equal to 10 × 10 × 10 = 103 = 1000. Thus the (maximum) number of tries is equal to 4 × 1000 = 4000.\n\n\n\n\n\nA code has five elements: three digits and two letters If the digits of the code are distinct, then the total number of possible codes is equal to : 20 x 10 x 9 x 8 x 26 x 26 10 x 10 x 9 x 8 x 26 x 26 10 x 10 x 9 x 8 x 26 x 25 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 26 x 26\nFeedback: We multiply the number of possibilities to place the 2 letters (therefore the 3 digits) among 5 positions: 𝐶_5^2 (= 𝐶_5^3 )=10 , by the number of arrangements without repetition of 3 (distinct) digits 10x9x8 by the number of arrangements with repetition of 2 letters 26x26\n\n\n\nA code has five elements: three digits and two letters If the code begins with the digit 0, then the total number of possible codes is equal to : 26 x 26 x 10 x 10 10 x 26 x 25 x 10 x 9 6 x 26 x 26 x 10 x 10 10 x 26 x 25 x 10 x 9\nFeedback: If the code starts with 0, there are 2 numbers and 2 letters left to place. We multiply the number of possibilities to place the 2 letters (therefore the 2 digits) among 4 positions: 𝐶_4^2=6 , by the number of arrangements with repetition of 2 digits 10x10 by the number of arrangements with repetition of 2 letters 26x26\n\n\n\nA code has five elements: three digits and two letters If the code begins with the letter A, then the total number of possible codes is equal to : 26 x 10 x 10 x 10 26 x 26 x 10 x 10 4 x 26 x 10 x 10 x 10 26 x 10 x 9 x 8\nFeedback: If the code begins with A, there are 1 letter and 3 numbers left to place. We multiply the number of possibilities to place the letter (therefore the 3 digits) among 4 positions: 𝐶_41=(𝐶_43 )=4 , by the number of possible letters 26 by the number of arrangements with repetition of 3 digits 10x10x10\n\n\n\nA code has five elements: three digits and two letters If the code begins with two letters, then the total number of possible codes is equal to : 26 x 25 x 10 x 9 x 8 26 x 25 x 10 x 10 x 10\n26 x 26 x 10 x 10 x 10\n26 x 26 x 10 x 9 x 8\nFeedback: If the code begins with 2 letters, the positions of the 2 letters and the 3 digits are imposed. We just multiply the number of arrangements with repetition of 2 letters 26x26 by the number of arrangements with repetition of 3 digits 10x10x10\n\n\n\nA code is made up of two digits and two letters of the alphabet in all possible orders. Thus, we can deduce that if the digits of the code are distinct, then the total number of possible codes is equal to: 10 x 9 x 26 x 26 6 x 10 x 9 x 26 x 26 12 x 10 x 9 x 26 x 26 4 x 10 x 9 x 26 x 26\nFeedback: We multiply the number of possibilities to place the 2 letters (therefore the 2 digits) among 4 positions: 𝐶_4^2=6 , by the number of arrangements without repetition of 2 (distinct) digits 10x9 by the number of arrangements with repetition of 2 letters 26x26\n\n\n\nA code is made up of two digits and two letters of the alphabet in all possible orders. Thus, we can deduce that if the code begins with the number 0, then the total number of possible codes is equal to: 10 x 26 x 26 2 x 10 x 26 x 26 3 x 10 x 26 x 26 4 x 10 x 26 x 26\nFeedback: If the code starts with 0, there are 1 digits and 2 letters left to place.

For example:\n\nnumber of heads appearing after ten throws of a coin,\nnumber of vehicles passing an intersection in a day,\nnumber of customers entering a store on Saturday.\n\nContinuous random variables, on the other hand, can take on any value in a given interval. For example, the mass of an animal would be a continuous random variable, as it could theoretically be any non-negative number.\nLet \\(X\\) be a discrete random variable. The law, also called distribution of \\(X\\) is the list of probabilities attributed to each of its possible values. Explicitly, for any \\(x \\in X(\\Omega)\\), we associate a value between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\) corresponding to the probability that the event \\(X = x\\) is realized and noted \\(P(X = x)\\).\nRemark: Suppose \\(X(\\Omega) = \\{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\\}\\). Therefore:\n\\[P( X = x_1) + ... + P(X = x_n) =  \\sum_{\\substack{x \\in X(\\Omega)}} P(X = x) = 1\\]\n\n\n\nExpected value (mean) of a discrete random variable\nWe can calculate the expected value (or mean) of a discrete random variable as the weighted average of all the outcomes of that random variable based on their probabilities. We interpret expected value as the predicted average outcome if we looked at that random variable over an infinite number of trials. In mathematicals writing, we can say:\nLet \\(X\\) be a discrete random variable. Suppose that \\(X(\\Omega) = \\{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\\}\\). We denote \\(p_i = P(X = x_i)\\), for all \\(i \\in \\{1, ..., n\\}\\).\nThe expectation of \\(X\\) is defined by:\n\\[E(X) = \\frac{x_1 \\times P(X = x_1) + ... + x_n \\times P(X = x_n)}{P(X = x_1) + ... + P(X = x_n)}\\]\n\\[E(X) = \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i \\times p_i}{\\sum_{i = 1}^n p_i} = \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i \\times p_i}{1} = \\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i \\times p_i\\]\nThe expectation \\(E(X)\\) is also called the first-order moment of \\(X\\).\n\n\n\nVariance and standard deviation\nThe variance of a discrete random variable is defined by:\n\\[V(X) = E(X^2) - (E(X))^2\\]\nStandard deviation measures the dispersion of a distribution around the expectation. In a way, the standard deviation evaluates the “average width” of the distribution, so it is expressed in the same unit as the variable. A low value of the standard deviation, implies that the distribution is homogeneous around the expectation. In other words, a smaller value of the standard deviation, implies the distribution values are close to each other and to the expectation. On the other hand, a larger value of the standard deviation, implies that the distribution is spread out: the distribution values are distant from each other and from the expectation. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance:\n\\[\\sigma(X) = \\sqrt{V(X)}\\]\n𝜎(𝑋) = √(𝕍(𝑋) )⟺𝕍(𝑋) = (𝜎(𝑋))^2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nExample of samples from two populations with the same mean but different variances. The red population has mean 100 and variance 100 (Standard Deviation = 10) while the blue population has mean 100 and variance 2500 (Standard Deviation = 50).\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\n\n\n\n\nCoefficiant of variation\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_variation\n\nThe coefficient of variation of a random variable is defined by\n\\[CV(X) = \\frac{\\sigma(X)}{E(X)} \\times 100\\]\nThis percentage is also an indicator of the dispersion around the expectation. By convention, we have:\n\n\\(CV(X) &lt; 15\\%\\) implies that the distribution is homogeneous around the expectation,\n\\(CV(X) \\geq 15\\%\\) implies that the distribution is heterogeneous around the expectation.\n\n\n\nCumulative Distribution Function (CDF)\nThe cumulative distribution function is a function defined on \\(\\R\\) and with values in \\([0,1]\\), denoted by \\(F_X\\). For all \\(x \\in \\R\\).\n\\[F_X(x) = P(X \\leq x) = \\sum \\limits_{j \\in X(\\Omega), \\text{ such that } j \\leq x} P(X = j)\\]\nRemarks:\n\nThe cumulative distribution function is increasing,\nThe cumulative distribution function is a step function,\nThe set of points of discontinuity is \\(X(\\Omega)\\)\n\n\n\nSpecial class of random variable\n\nBernouilli Trial Bernoulli’s test Bernoulli’s test is any test with only two possible outcomes: Success and Failure. If 𝑋 is a real random variable counting the number of successes in a Bernoulli’s test, then we have the following two cases: [𝑋 = 1] is the event which correspond to Success : with a associated probability 0 ≤ 𝑝 ≤ 1 [𝑋 = 0] is the event which correspond to Failure : with a associated probability 𝑞 = 1 − 𝑝. We say that 𝑋 follows a law of Bernoulli with parameter 𝑝 that we denote 𝑋 ∼ ℬ(𝑝). We have 𝑋(Ω)={0, 1}. Moreover, 𝔼(𝑋)=𝑝 and 𝕍(𝑋)=𝑝𝑞 where 𝑞=1−𝑝. =&gt; faire une expérience en classe pour démontrer : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_trial\n\nThe Binomial law The random variable 𝑋= “total number of successes” after 𝑛 independent repetitions of a Bernoulli test, is called a Binomial random variable of parameters (𝑛, 𝑝) and is denoted : 𝑋∼ℬ(𝑛, 𝑝).\nBy definition, 𝑋 (Ω) = {0, 1, . . . , 𝑛}. The expression of the ℬ(𝑛, 𝑝) law is given by : 𝑝_𝑘 =ℙ(𝑋=𝑘)=𝐶_𝑛^𝑘 𝑝^𝑘 (1−𝑝)^(𝑛−𝑘), ∀ 𝑘∈𝑋(Ω), with 𝐶_𝑛^𝑘= 𝑛!/(𝑘!(𝑛−𝑘)!) By definition, 𝑋 = ∑2_(𝑖=1)^𝑛▒𝑋_𝑖 , where the 𝑋_𝑖 follow a Bernoulli ditribution with parameter 𝑝. The expectation of the Binomial distribution equals 𝔼(𝑋) = 𝑛𝑝 and its variance is equal to 𝕍(𝑋) = 𝑛𝑝𝑞, where 𝑞=1−𝑝\n\nThe Poisson law Let 𝜆&gt;0 be a fixed parameter. We say that the random variable 𝑋 with values in ℕ follows a Poisson law of parameter 𝜆 (denoted by 𝑋∼𝒫𝑜(𝜆)), if 𝑝_𝑘 =ℙ(𝑋=𝑘)=𝑒^(−𝜆) 𝜆^𝑘/𝑘!, ∀ 𝑘∈ℕ, Note that : 𝔼(𝑋) =𝕍(𝑋) = 𝜆.\nThe Poisson law can be seen as an approximation of the Binomial law when 𝑛 is “large” and 𝑝 is “small” (rare success).\n\nGeometric law The random variable 𝑋 which gives the rank of the first success (following the independent repetition of a Bernoulli’s test, having as probability of success 𝑝) is called Geometric random variable of parameter 𝑝 (denoted 𝑋 ~ 𝐺(𝑝)). By definition, 𝑋(Ω) =ℕ∖{0}. The expression of the 𝐺(𝑝) law is given by 𝑝_𝑘 =ℙ(𝑋=𝑘)=𝑝(1−𝑝)^(𝑘−1), ∀ 𝑘∈𝑋(Ω), We have : 𝔼(𝑋)=1/𝑝 𝕍(𝑋)=(1−𝑝)/𝑝^2\n𝐹_𝑋 (𝑘)=ℙ(𝑋 ≤𝑘)=1−(1−𝑝)^𝑘\nThe geometric law is often interpreted as being the lifetime or the date of death (discrete)\n\nLinear transformation Let 𝑋 be a discrete random variable. Let 𝑎 and 𝑏 be two real values. We set 𝑌 = 𝑎𝑋+𝑏. We have : 𝔼 (𝑌 ) = 𝑎 (𝔼(𝑋)) + 𝑏. 𝕍 (𝑌 ) = 𝑎^2 (𝕍(𝑋)). If 𝑎 &gt; 0, then 𝜎(𝑌 ) = 𝑎𝜎(𝑋) If 𝑎 &lt; 0, then 𝜎(𝑌 ) = (−𝑎)𝜎(𝑋)\n\nBinomial - Poisson Approximation :\nLet 𝑋 ~ ℬ(𝑛, 𝑝)\nIf 𝑛 is large enough (≥ 30) and 𝑝 is low (≤ 0.1) such that 𝑛𝑝 &lt; 15, then we can approach the Binomial law by the Poisson law of parameter 𝜆 = 𝑛𝑝, i.e.  ℙ(𝑋=𝑘)≈𝑒^(−𝜆) 𝜆^𝑘/𝑘!\n— detailed examples\nLet the binomial law : 𝑋 ~ ℬ(100, 0.09) 𝑛=100 et 𝑝=0,09 What is the value of the probability ℙ (𝑋 ≤ 5) ?

Every 2 hours, 50 parts are randomly selected (with replacement) from the transistors produced. The number of defective parts found is a random variable 𝑋. a) Determine the distribution of 𝑋. Calculate 𝐸(𝑋) and 𝑉(𝑋). b) The following quality control rule is adopted: production will be stopped if our sample contains at least 3 defective parts. What is the probability that the production will be stopped? c) What other law can be used to approach the distribution of 𝑋? Let 𝑌 be the random variable with the approximation law above. d) Calculate 𝑃 (𝑌 ≥ 3). Let 𝑍 = −2𝑌 + 5. e) Calculate 𝐸(𝑍) et 𝑉(𝑍). Let 𝑇 be the random variable that corresponds to the number of tests before getting the first defective part. f) Determine the distribution of 𝑇 g) Calculate 𝑃 (𝑇 ≤ 2). h) Calculate 𝐸(𝑇) and 𝑉(𝑇)\nRéponse\n\n𝑋 is the random variable that represents the number of defective parts among 50 parts drawn randomly. By definition, 𝑋 follows a Binomial law with parameters 𝑛 = 50 and 𝑝 = 0.02 (the probability that a part is defective). Therefore, we have :\n\n𝐸(𝑋) = 𝑛 𝑝 = 1 and 𝑉(𝑋) = 𝑛 𝑝 (1 −𝑝) = 0.98\n\nThe production will be stopped if:\n𝑃(𝑋≥3)=1−𝑃(𝑋≤2)=1−(𝑃(𝑋=0)+𝑃(𝑋=1)+𝑃(𝑋=2)) = 0.07842775\n\nTh- e conditions for approximation of the Binomial distribution by a Poisson law are satisfied, and its parameter is 𝜆 = 𝐸(𝑋) = 1,.  \n\nNow suppose that 𝑌 follows a Poisson distribution with parameter 𝜆=1. We have: 𝑃(𝑌≥3)=1−𝑃(𝑌≤2)=1−(𝑃(𝑌=0)+𝑃(𝑌=1)+𝑃(𝑌=2)) = 0.0803014 Remark : 𝑃(𝑋≥3) ≈ 𝑃 (𝑌 ≥ 3)\nLet 𝑍=−2𝑌+5. Hence, we have : 𝐸(𝑍)=−2 𝐸(𝑌)+5=3 and 𝑉(𝑍) = 4 𝑉(𝑌) = 4.\nLet us define 𝑇 as the random variable which corresponds to the number of trials before obtaining the first defective part. We notice that : 𝑇(Ω) =ℕ (the set of natural numbers). Note that 𝑊 = 𝑇 + 1 corresponds to the rank of first appearance of the defective part. By definition, 𝑊 follows a geometric law with parameter 𝑝 = 0.02 (the probability that a part is defective)\nSo, for all 𝑘 ∈ 𝑁, we have : 𝑃 (𝑇 = 𝑘) = 𝑃 (𝑊 − 1 = 𝑘) = 𝑃 (𝑊 = 𝑘 + 1) = 𝑝 〖(1 − 𝑝)〗^((𝑘 + 1) − 1) = 𝑝 〖(1 − 𝑝)〗^(𝑘 )  𝑃 (𝑇 ≤ 2)= 𝑃 (𝑊 − 1 ≤ 2)= 𝑃 (𝑊 ≤ 3)= 1 − (1 − 𝑝)^3\nand we have: 𝐸(𝑇)= 𝐸(𝑊 − 1)= 𝐸(𝑊)− 1 = 1/𝑝 − 1 = (1 − 𝑝)/𝑝 V(T) = V (W − 1) = V(W) = (1 − 𝑝)/𝑝^2\n\n\n\nmoodle\n1/ 70 people are about to pass through the airport security gate.

    "text": "The science of statistics deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. We see and use data in our everyday lives.\nIn this course, you will learn how to organize and summarize data. Organizing and summarizing data is called descriptive statistics. Two ways to summarize data are by graphing and by using numbers (for example, finding an average). After you have studied probability and probability distributions, you will use formal methods for drawing conclusions from “good” data. The formal methods are called inferential statistics. Statistical inference uses probability to determine how confident we can be that our conclusions are correct.\nEffective interpretation of data (inference) is based on good procedures for producing data and thoughtful examination of the data. You will encounter what will seem to be too many mathematical formulas for interpreting data. The goal of statistics is not to perform numerous calculations using the formulas, but to gain an understanding of your data. The calculations can be done using a calculator or a computer. The understanding must come from you. If you can thoroughly grasp the basics of statistics, you can be more confident in the decisions you make in life.\n\n\n\nProbability is a mathematical tool used to study randomness. It deals with the chance (the likelihood) of an event occurring. For example, if you toss a fair coin four times, the outcomes may not be two heads and two tails. However, if you toss the same coin 4,000 times, the outcomes will be close to half heads and half tails. The expected theoretical probability of heads in any one toss is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) or 0.5. Even though the outcomes of a few repetitions are uncertain, there is a regular pattern of outcomes when there are many repetitions.\nThe theory of probability began with the study of games of chance such as poker. Predictions take the form of probabilities. To predict the likelihood of an earthquake, of rain, we use probabilities. Doctors use probability to determine the chance of a vaccination causing the disease the vaccination is supposed to prevent. A stockbroker uses probability to determine the rate of return on a client’s investments. You might use probability to decide to buy a lottery ticket or not. In your study of statistics, you will use the power of mathematics through probability calculations to analyze and interpret your data.\n\n\n\nIn statistics, we generally want to study a population. You can think of a population as a collection of persons, things, or objects under study. To study the population, we select a sample. The idea of sampling is to select a portion (or subset) of the larger population and study that portion (the sample) to gain information about the population. Data are the result of sampling from a population.\nBecause it takes a lot of time and money to examine an entire population, sampling is a very practical technique. If you wished to compute the overall grade point average at your school, it would make sense to select a sample of students who attend the school. The data collected from the sample would be the students’ grade point averages. In presidential elections, opinion poll samples of 1,000–2,000 people are taken. The opinion poll is supposed to represent the views of the people in the entire country. Manufacturers of canned carbonated drinks take samples to determine if a 16 ounce can contains 16 ounces of carbonated drink.\nFrom the sample data, we can calculate a statistic. A statistic is a number that represents a property of the sample. For example, if we consider one math class to be a sample of the population of all math classes, then the average number of points earned by students in that one math class at the end of the term is an example of a statistic. The statistic is an estimate of a population parameter, in this case the mean. A parameter is a numerical characteristic of the whole population that can be estimated by a statistic. Since we considered all math classes to be the population, then the average number of points earned per student over all the math classes is an example of a parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs statistics accurate?\n\n\n\nOne of the main concerns in the field of statistics is how accurately a statistic estimates a parameter. The accuracy really depends on how well the sample represents the population. The sample must contain the characteristics of the population in order to be a representative sample. We are interested in both the sample statistic and the population parameter in inferential statistics. In a later chapter, we will use the sample statistic to test the validity of the established population parameter.\n\n\nA variable, or random variable, usually notated by capital letters such as \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), is a characteristic or measurement that can be determined for each member of a population. Variables may be numerical or categorical:\n\nNumerical variables take on values with equal units such as weight in pounds and time in hours.\nCategorical variables place the person or thing into a category.\n\nIf we let \\(X\\) equal the number of points earned by one math student at the end of a term, then \\(X\\) is a numerical variable. If we let \\(Y\\) be a person’s party affiliation, then some examples of \\(Y\\) include Republican, Democrat, and Independent. \\(Y\\) is a categorical variable. We could do some math with values of \\(X\\) (calculate the average number of points earned, for example), but it makes no sense to do math with values of \\(Y\\) (calculating an average party affiliation makes no sense).\nData are the actual values of the variable. They may be numbers or they may be words.\nTwo words that come up often in statistics are mean and proportion. If you were to take three exams in your math classes and obtain scores of 86, 75, and 92, you would calculate your mean score by adding the three exam scores and dividing by three (your mean score would be 84.3 to one decimal place). If, in your math class, there are 40 students and 22 are men and 18 are women, then the proportion of men students is \\(\\frac{22}{40}\\) and the proportion of women students is \\(\\frac{18}{40}\\). Mean and proportion are discussed in more detail in later chapters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage or mean ?\n\n\n\nThe words “mean” and “average” are often used interchangeably. The substitution of one word for the other is common practice. The technical term is arithmetic mean, and “average” is technically a center location. However, in practice among non-statisticians, “average” is commonly accepted for “arithmetic mean.”\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD;\n    population[Population]==&gt; |a portion (or subset) of the population|sample(Sample);\n    sample --&gt; statistic(Statistic);\n    B --&gt; D;\n    C --&gt; D;"

The data collected from the sample would be the students’ grade point averages. In presidential elections, opinion poll samples of 1,000–2,000 people are taken. The opinion poll is supposed to represent the views of the people in the entire country. Manufacturers of canned carbonated drinks take samples to determine if a 16 ounce can contains 16 ounces of carbonated drink.\nFrom the sample data, we can calculate a statistic. A statistic is a number that represents a property of the sample. For example, if we consider one math class to be a sample of the population of all math classes, then the average number of points earned by students in that one math class at the end of the term is an example of a statistic. The statistic is an estimate of a population parameter, in this case the mean. A parameter is a numerical characteristic of the whole population that can be estimated by a statistic. Since we considered all math classes to be the population, then the average number of points earned per student over all the math classes is an example of a parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs statistics accurate?\n\n\n\nOne of the main concerns in the field of statistics is how accurately a statistic estimates a parameter. The accuracy really depends on how well the sample represents the population. The sample must contain the characteristics of the population in order to be a representative sample. We are interested in both the sample statistic and the population parameter in inferential statistics. In a later chapter, we will use the sample statistic to test the validity of the established population parameter.\n\n\nA variable, or random variable, usually notated by capital letters such as \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), is a characteristic or measurement that can be determined for each member of a population. Variables may be numerical or categorical:\n\nNumerical variables take on values with equal units such as weight in pounds and time in hours.\nCategorical variables place the person or thing into a category.\n\nIf we let \\(X\\) equal the number of points earned by one math student at the end of a term, then \\(X\\) is a numerical variable. If we let \\(Y\\) be a person’s party affiliation, then some examples of \\(Y\\) include Republican, Democrat, and Independent. \\(Y\\) is a categorical variable. We could do some math with values of \\(X\\) (calculate the average number of points earned, for example), but it makes no sense to do math with values of \\(Y\\) (calculating an average party affiliation makes no sense).\nData are the actual values of the variable. They may be numbers or they may be words.\nTwo words that come up often in statistics are mean and proportion. If you were to take three exams in your math classes and obtain scores of 86, 75, and 92, you would calculate your mean score by adding the three exam scores and dividing by three (your mean score would be 84.3 to one decimal place). If, in your math class, there are 40 students and 22 are men and 18 are women, then the proportion of men students is \\(\\frac{22}{40}\\) and the proportion of women students is \\(\\frac{18}{40}\\). Mean and proportion are discussed in more detail in later chapters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage or mean ?\n\n\n\nThe words “mean” and “average” are often used interchangeably. The substitution of one word for the other is common practice. The technical term is arithmetic mean, and “average” is technically a center location. However, in practice among non-statisticians, “average” is commonly accepted for “arithmetic mean.”"

In our example, there are four Merchandising Display Systems, which means that we have six comparisons to make. If we consider an additional system, we will have ten comparisons to make, etc…\nInflation of the number of tests  increases the risk α. Back to our example, we set α = 5%.

There are statistics about crime, sports, education, politics, and real estate. Typically, when you read a newspaper article or watch a television news program, you are given sample information. With this information, you may make a decision about the correctness of a statement, claim, or “fact.” Statistical methods can help you make the “best educated guess.”\nSince you will undoubtedly be given statistical information at some point in your life, you need to know some techniques for analyzing the information thoughtfully. Think about buying a house or managing a budget. Think about your chosen profession. The fields of economics, business, psychology, education, biology, law, computer science, police science, and early childhood development require at least one course in statistics.\nIncluded in this chapter are the basic ideas and words of probability and statistics.

Here, “dX” refers to a die with X faces, numbered from 1 to X, each with an equally likely probability of being rolled.\nBoth people randomly pick one die from their respective bags and then roll them at the same time. For example, suppose the two dice selected are a d4 and a d12. The players roll them, and let’s further suppose that both rolls come up as 3. What luck!\nWhat’s the probability of something like this happening? That is, what is the probability that both players roll the same number, whether or not they happened to pick the same kind of die?\n\n\nSolution\nCongratulations to the (randomly selected) winner from last week: 🎻 Nigel 🎻 from Sanderstead, England. I received 81 timely submissions, of which 60 were correct—good for a 74 percent solve rate. I was pleased to see a very healthy increase in the number of solvers as compared to two weeks ago. Way to bounce back, everyone!\nLast week, two people were sitting at a table together, each with their own bag of six “DnD dice”: a d4, a d6, a d8, a d10, a d12, and a d20. Here, “dX” referred to a die with X faces, numbered from 1 to X, each with an equally likely probability of being rolled.\nBoth people randomly picked one die from their respective bags and then rolled them at the same time. For example, suppose the two dice selected were a d4 and a d12. The players rolled them, and both rolls come up as 3. What luck!\nWhat was the probability of something like this happening? That is, what was the probability that both players rolled the same number, whether or not they happened to pick the same kind of die?\nA good first step was to work out the probability of rolling each number. For example, what was the probability of rolling a 20?\nTo figure this out, many readers counted up the faces on all the dice. The d4 had 4 faces, the d6 had 6 faces, and so on. In total, there were 60 faces. Only one of these was a 20, which meant the probability of rolling a 20 was 1/60. Right?\nNot quite. Why? By this logic, you had a 4-in-60 chance of picking the d4, a 6-in-60 chance of picking the d6, and so on. However, the puzzle said that each player picked a die at random, implying that each die had the same 1-in-6 chance of being selected. So the probability of rolling a 20 was not in fact 1/60. First, you needed to pick the d20 (a 1-in-6 chance) and then, given that you were rolling the d20, you needed to actually roll a 20 (a 1-in-20 chance). Combining these meant the probability of rolling a 20 was in fact (1/6)·(1/20), or 1/120. The probability was the same for rolling 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, and 13.\nMeanwhile, your chances of rolling a 12 were greater, since there were two dice, the d20 and the d12, that could have resulted in a 12. As before, you had a 1-in-20 chance of picking the d20 and a 1-in-20 chance of then rolling the 12. But this time, you also had a 1-in-6 chance of picking the d12 and a 1-in-12 chance of then rolling a 12. Combining these cases meant the probability of rolling a 12 was (1/6)·(1/20) + (1/6)·(1/12), which simplified to 1/120 + 1/72, or 1/45. The probability was the same for rolling 11.\nContinuing in this fashion (i.e., adding up the respective probabilities of the dice that could have resulted in each roll), you got the following:\nThe probability of rolling 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, or 13 was 1/120.\nThe probability of rolling a 12 or 11 was 1/45.\nThe probability of rolling a 10 or 9 was 7/180.\nThe probability of rolling an 8 or 7 was 43/720.\nThe probability of rolling a 6 or 5 was 7/80.\nThe probability of rolling a 4, 3, 2, or 1 was 31/240.\nAt this point, I’d like to quickly note that you were more likely than not to roll a 1, 2, 3, or 4, as this collective probability was approximately 51.7 percent. I found that a little surprising.\nOkay, back to the puzzle. So far, we’ve worked out all the probabilities for one person’s roll. With two people rolling, you could determine the probability of each pair of rolls by creating a grid in which each row was one player’s roll and each column was the other player’s roll. Since the rolls were independent, the probability of the pair was the product of two respective probabilities.\nHere’s what that grid looked like, with likelier pairs shown in yellow:\n\nA grid in a spreadsheet. There are 20 rows, numbered from 1 to 20, representing the roll of the first player. There are also 20 columns, representing the roll of the second player. The respective probabilities of each roll are also shown. In the grid are 400 cells, with each cell showing the product of the probability from its row and column. The cells are color-coded, so that higher values appear yellower. Cells along the main diagonal have a thicker black border. The cells outlined in black along the main diagonal of the grid were precisely when both players rolled the same value. And so, the answer to the puzzle was the sum of these 20 cells, also known as the trace of the grid (or “matrix”).\nThe exact answer was 4(31/240)2 + 2(7/80)2 + 2(43/720)2 + 2(7/180)2 + 2(1/45)2 + 8(1/120)2, which simplified to 3/32, or 9.375 percent.\nSeveral solvers, like Sameer G. of Ithaca, New York, neatly arrived at the same result with a little less computation. Sameer worked out the probabilities with which the players had the same roll, for each possible pair of dice they picked. For example, if both players picked a d4, the probability they had the same roll was 1/4. If one picked a d4 and the other picked a d6, the probability was now 1/6. In general, if the two dice were dX and dY, the rolls were the same with probability 1/max(X, Y). Computing the average probability across all 36 possible pairs for X and Y, Sameer arrived at the same result of 3/32.\nIn the end, despite having six different dice to choose from, the probability that both players rolled the same number wasn’t too much less than it would have been if they had both rolled a standard die (i.e., d6). This was largely thanks to the fact that every die had the numbers 1 through 4, which accounted for the majority of the time the players had the same roll."

(For example: height and weight or age and number of accidents)\nThe goal remains the same as when we studied the Chi-square test, that is: Study the possible link between these two variables.\nIn other words, the linear correlation coefficient test is used to study the existence or not of a link between two quantitative variables in a given population.\nModeling Framework : Population Variables studied simultaneously: X and Y real random variables (i.e. both variables are quantitative) Postulate: the couple Z = (X,Y) has an « L » Distribution Goal: to study the dependence between X and Y The unknown value :   ρ (X,Y)\nWe want to test H0 : ρ (X,Y) = 0 against H1 : ρ (X,Y) ≠ 0\nThe above test is a two-tailed test.

Calculate 𝐸(𝑋) and 𝜎(𝑋) Using an approximation that will be justified, calculate the probabilities of the following events: 𝑃 (𝑋 ≤ 500) 𝑃 (500 ≤ 𝑋 ≤ 520)\nSolution\nLet 𝑋 be the random variable that represents the number of people who voted for Mr. Smith among the 1000 respondents (the number of successes among 1000 tries, with a probability of success 𝑝 = 0.513)\nBy definition, 𝑋 follows a binomial distribution with parameters 𝑛 = 1000 and 𝑝 = 0.513. Thus, we have\n𝐸(𝑋) = 𝑛 𝑝 =513 and 𝜎 (𝑋) = √(𝑉 (𝑋)) = √(𝑛 𝑝 (1 − 𝑝)) = 15.80604 ≈ 15.8\nThe conditions for approximation of the binomial law by a normal law (with parameters 𝑚=513 and 𝜎=15.8) are satisfied. Let Y ~ 𝑁 (𝑚, 𝜎). We set 𝑍 = (𝑋 − 𝑚)/𝜎. Thanks to this change of variable, we obtain that 𝑍 follows a standard normal law.\nSo we get:  𝑃 (𝑋 ≤ 500) ≈ 𝑃 (𝑌 ≤ 500) = 𝑃 (𝑍 ≤ −0.82) = 0.2061081 𝑃(500≤𝑋≤520)≈𝑃(500≤𝑌≤520) =𝑃(−0.82≤𝑍≤1.44)=0.46\nExercice 4\nWhat is the probability of getting 2 at least 1050 times in 6000 rolls of a (balanced) dice?\nSolution\nLet 𝑋 be the random variable representing the number of twos one gets, among the 6000 die rolls (the number of successes among 6000 tries, with a probability of success p = 1/6)   By definition, 𝑋 follows a binomial distribution with parameters 𝑛 = 6000 and p = 1/6. Thus, we have :   𝐸(𝑋) = 𝑛 𝑝 =1000 and 𝜎 (𝑋) = √(𝑉 (𝑋)) = √(𝑛 𝑝 (1 − 𝑝)) = 28.86751 ≈ 28.87   The conditions for approximation of the binomial distribution by a normal distribution (with parameters 𝑚 = 175 and 𝜎 = 12.87) are satisfied. Let Y ~ 𝑁 (𝑚, 𝜎) . We set 𝑍 = (𝑋 − 𝑚)/𝜎. Thanks to this change of variable, we obtain that 𝑍 follows a reduced centered normal law.\nTherefore :  𝑃 (𝑋 ≥ 1050) ≈ 𝑃 (𝑌 ≥ 1050) = 1 − 𝑃 (𝑍 ≤ 1.73) ≈ 0.04181514\n\n\nmoodle test\nQuestion 1\nLet the variable X follow the normal law 𝒩(100, 30)\nThe probability ℙ(𝑋 ≤150) is: 0.3522 0.5522 0.7522 0.9522\nFeedback: Use a change of variable to obtain a standard normal distribution.

Is the effect of the treatment independent of the dose administered? Is there a link between hair color and eye color? Is there a link between marital status and job type? Etc…\nThe Chi-square test is used to check the existence or not of a link between two characters in a given population:\nWhen both characteristics are qualitative When one characteristic is qualitative and the other is quantitative When both characteristics are quantitative but the values have been grouped (in classes)\nThe first characteristic, designated by X, can be a quantitative or qualitative characteristic, with categories (or classes) [generally resulting from a grouping of the values of a quantitative characteristic or the modalities of a non-quantitative characteristic]. We will thus have the classes A1; … ;Ap  X has p modalities\nThe second characteristic, designated by Y, can be a quantitative or qualitative characteristic, with categories (or classes) [generally resulting from a grouping of the values of a quantitative characteristic or the modalities of a non-quantitative characteristic]. We will thus have the classes B1; … ;Bq  Y has q modalities\nThe purpose of the Chi-square test is to test:\nH0 : X and Y are independent\n    against\nH1 : X and Y are dependent\nTo do this, we take a sample from the population considered. This sample of size n is represented by a contingency table of dimension p x q.\n\n1 Notations\n\nni,j represents the number of people who belong simultaneously to the category Ai of the dimension X and to the category Bj of the dimension Y\nni,. represents the sum of the numbers belonging to the category Ai of the dimension X\nn.,j represents the sum of the numbers belonging to the category Bi of the dimension Y\n\n2 The formulas to perform the test We need to calculate the following expression (called Computed Chi-square):\n\nOù\nThe test statistic uobs is therefore a comparison between the observed numbers and the theoretical numbers (Ei,j), i.e. the numbers under the hypothesis of independence.\nDecision rule : We reject H0 if uobs ≥ k, otherwise we do not reject H0  This implies: the rejection of the independence of the two characters X and Y\nwhere k is defined as follows F(k) = 1- α, with F is the distribution function of the Chi-square distribution with υ = (p – 1) x (q -1) degrees of freedom\nk is calculated from the Chi-square distribution.\nCondition of use : Ei,j ≥ 5 for all i = 1; …. ; p and j = 1; … ; q.

In other words, the data do not confirm a link between the two variables at an α% risk.\nAn experimental anti-Covid treatment is administered at three different doses d1, d2, d3 to a group of subjects with Sars-Cov-2 virus. The experiment is done in double blind. The number of subjects cured and the number of subjects not cured is counted for each dose.

To do so, the association asked a polling institute to study the link between the nature of an injury following an accident and the wearing of a seat belt. A random sample of 10,779 drivers involved in an accident yielded the following results:\nCan we say with a 5% risk, that there is a link between seat belt use and the nature of the injury?

    "section": "Preamble",
    "text": "Preamble\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program–to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\nFor the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users’ and authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users’ freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow."

    "text": "TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n0. Definitions.\n“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\nTo “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.\nA “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\nTo “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\nTo “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\nAn interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n\n1. Source Code.\nThe “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.\nA “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\nThe “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\nThe “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work’s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\n\n2. Basic Permissions.\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\n\n3. Protecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work’s users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\n\n4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n\n5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n\nThe work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n\nThe work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.\n\n\nYou must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n\nIf the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\n\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n\n\nConvey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n\nConvey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n\nConvey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\n\n\nConvey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n\nConvey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\nA “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\n\n7. Additional Terms.\n“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n\nDisclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n\nRequiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n\nProhibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n\nLimiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\n\n\nDeclining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n\nRequiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n\n\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\n\n8. Termination.\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\n\n9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n\n10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\nAn “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n\n11. Patents.\nA “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor version”.\nA contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\nIn the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\nA patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n\n12. No Surrender of Others’ Freedom.\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n\n13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\n\n14. Revised Versions of this License.\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\n\n15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n\n16. Limitation of Liability.\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\n17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS"

    "text": "How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\n    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n    &lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\nThe hypothetical commands `show w’ and `show c’ should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program’s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see https://www.gnu.org/licenses/.\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html."
