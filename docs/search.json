My academic side ran parallel — teaching statistics, financial analysis, and information systems at top business schools, instilling analytical rigor and adaptability.\nHands-on with GitHub, I write, experiment, and explore: bridging data, defense, and human behavior to uncover and harden vulnerabilities.\nToday, I’m immersed in cybersecurity, building skills in digital forensics, secure network design, and incident investigation. My passion lies at the nexus of data, security safeguards, and the behaviors that drive human error.\n\n\nPython · R · Git · Data analysis · Risk awareness\nMore on my resume\n\n\n\nData Scientist | Adjunct Professor | Lifelong Learner\n\n\n  「  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  」  \n\n\n\n\n🔭 I’m currently working on Ranking up on HackTheBox\n🌱 I’m learning Penetration Testing\n👯 Always happy to collaborate on open source projects\n💬 Ask me about Economy, Finance, Math, or Machine Learning\n📫 How to reach me: LinkedIn\n⚡ Fun fact: “skekCoon” is a mix of Skeksis (from The Dark Crystal) and my best friend—a Maine Coon."
