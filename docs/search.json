My academic side ran parallel — teaching statistics, financial analysis, and information systems at top business schools, instilling analytical rigor and adaptability.\nHands-on with GitHub, I write, experiment, and explore: bridging data, defense, and human behavior to uncover and harden vulnerabilities.\nToday, I’m immersed in cybersecurity, building skills in digital forensics, secure network design, and incident investigation. My passion lies at the nexus of data, security safeguards, and the behaviors that drive human error.\n\n\nPython · R · Git · Data analysis · Risk awareness\nMore on my resume\n\n\n\nData Scientist | Adjunct Professor | Lifelong Learner\n\n\n  「  \n\n\n \n\n    \n\n                \n                            \n                                \n                    \n    \n        \n            Breaking, fixing, and securing—one keystroke at a time.\n        \n    \n \n\n\n  」  \n\n\n\n\n🔭 I’m currently working on Ranking up on HackTheBox\n🌱 I’m learning Penetration Testing\n👯 Always happy to collaborate on open source projects\n💬 Ask me about Economy, Finance, Math, or Machine Learning\n📫 How to reach me: LinkedIn\n⚡ Fun fact: “skekCoon” is a mix of Skeksis (from The Dark Crystal) and my best friend—a Maine Coon."

    "text": "GitHub Codespaces are a development environment that’s hosted in the cloud. Codespace uses a container to provide common languages, tools, and utilities for development. Projects are customizable by configuring dev container files inside the repository (often known as configuration-as-code), which creates a repeatable codespace configuration. Once, initially configured, it is very simple to share custom-made development environment.\nEach codespace is hosted by GitHub in a Docker container, running on a virtual machine. All GitHub personal accounts include: - \\(120\\) hours of free compute time. - \\(15\\) GB storage a month.\n\n\nWhen you work in a codespace, the environment you are working in is created using a development container, or dev container, hosted on a virtual machine. You can configure the dev container for a repository so that codespaces created for that repository give you a tailored development environment, complete with all the tools and runtimes you need to work on a specific project.\nThe configuration files for a dev container are contained in a .devcontainer directory in your repository.\n\n\n\nThe primary file in a dev container configuration is the devcontainer.json file, usually located in the .devcontainer directory of your repository. It determine the environment of codespaces created for your repository.\n{\n  \"image\": \"mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/universal:linux\",\n  \"features\": {}\n}\n\n\nThe default Linux image is perfect start. It is based on Ubuntu packed with several programming language : Python, Node.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, C++, Java, C#, F#, .NET Core, PHP, Go, Ruby, and Conda.\n\n\n\nDev Container Features are self-contained units of installation code and development container configuration. Features are designed to install atop a wide-range of base container images.\n\n\n\n\n\"hostRequirements\": While devcontainer.json does not focus on hardware or VM provisioning, it can be useful to know one container’s minimum RAM, CPU, and storage requirements.\n\"postCreateCommand\": This command finalizes container setup when a dev container is created. We’ll use it to install Python packges listed inside requirements.txt file.\n\"customization\": Customize the user experience while working inside hte container."
