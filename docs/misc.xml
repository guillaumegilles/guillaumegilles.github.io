<h1>Data, Sampling, and Variation in Data and Sampling Data</h1>
<p>Data may come from a population or from a sample. Lowercase letters like <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> or <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y"> generally are used to represent data values. Most data can be put into the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Qualitative</li>
<li>Quantitative</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Qualitative data</strong> are the result of categorizing or describing attributes of a population. Qualitative data are also often called <strong>categorical data</strong>. Hair color, blood type, ethnic group, the car a person drives, and the street a person lives on are examples of qualitative (categorical) data. Qualitative (categorical) data are generally described by words or letters. For instance, hair color might be black, dark brown, light brown, blonde, gray, or red. Blood type might be AB+, O-, or B+. Researchers often prefer to use quantitative data over qualitative (categorical) data because it lends itself more easily to mathematical analysis. For example, it does not make sense to find an average hair color or blood type.</p>
<p><strong>Quantitative data</strong> are always numbers. Quantitative data are the result of <strong>counting</strong> or <strong>measuring</strong> attributes of a population. Amount of money, pulse rate, weight, number of people living in your town, and number of students who take statistics are examples of quantitative data. Quantitative data may be either <strong>discrete</strong> or <strong>continuous</strong>.</p>
<p>All data that are the result of counting are called <strong>quantitative discrete data</strong>. These data take on only certain numerical values. If you count the number of phone calls you receive for each day of the week, you might get values such as zero, one, two, or three.</p>
<p>Data that are not only made up of counting numbers, but that may include fractions, decimals, or irrational numbers, are called <strong>quantitative continuous data</strong>. Continuous data are often the results of measurements like lengths, weights, or times. A list of the lengths in minutes for all the phone calls that you make in a week, with numbers like <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2.4">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?7.5">, or <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?11.0">, would be quantitative continuous data.</p>

<p>Below are tables comparing the number of part-time and full-time students at De Anza College and Foothill College enrolled for the most recent spring quarter. The tables display counts (frequencies) and percentages or proportions (relative frequencies). The percent columns make comparing the same categories in the colleges easier. Displaying percentages along with the numbers is often helpful, but it is particularly important when comparing sets of data that do not have the same totals, such as the total enrollments for both colleges in this example. Notice how much larger the percentage for part-time students at Foothill College is compared to De Anza College.</p>
<div class="line-block">De Anza College | Foothill College |<br>
| Number | Percent | | Number | Percent|</div>
<p>|-|——–|———|-|——–|——–| |Full-time | 9,200 | 40.9% | Full-time | 4,059 | 28.6% | | Part-time| 13,296| 59.1%| Part-time | 10,124 | 71.4% | |Total| 22,496 | 100% | Total | 14,183 | 100% |</p>
<p>Tables are a good way of organizing and displaying data. But graphs can be even more helpful in understanding the data. There are no strict rules concerning which graphs to use. Two graphs that are used to display qualitative (categorical) data are <strong>pie charts</strong> and <strong>bar graphs</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>In a pie chart, categories of data are represented by wedges in a circle and are proportional in size to the percent of individuals in each category.</li>
<li>In a bar graph, the length of the bar for each category is proportional to the number or percent of individuals in each category. Bars may be vertical or horizontal.</li>
<li>A Pareto chart consists of bars that are sorted into order by category size (largest to smallest).</li>
</ul>

<p>It is a good idea to look at a variety of graphs to see which is the most helpful in displaying the data. We might make different choices of what we think is the “best” graph depending on the data and the context. Our choice also depends on what we are using the data for.</p>

<section id="percentages-that-add-to-more-or-less-than-100" class="level2 {callout-tip}">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="percentages-that-add-to-more-or-less-than-100">Percentages That Add to More (or Less) Than 100%</h2>
<p>Sometimes percentages add up to be more than 100% (or less than 100%). In the graph, the percentages add to more than 100% because students can be in more than one category. A bar graph is appropriate to compare the relative size of the categories. <strong>A pie chart cannot be used</strong>. It also could not be used if the percentages added to less than 100%.</p>
</section>
<section id="omitting-categoriesmissing-data" class="level2 {callout-tip}">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="omitting-categoriesmissing-data">Omitting Categories/Missing Data</h2>
<p>The table displays Ethnicity of Students but is missing the “Other/Unknown” category. This category contains people who did not feel they fit into any of the ethnicity categories or declined to respond. Notice that the frequencies do not add up to the total number of students. In this situation, create a bar graph and not a pie chart.</p>
</section>
<p>The following graph is the same as the previous graph but the “Other/Unknown” percent (9.6%) has been included. The “Other/Unknown” category is large compared to some of the other categories (Native American, 0.6%, Pacific Islander 1.0%). This is important to know when we think about what the data are telling us.</p>
<p>This particular bar graph in Figure 1.8 can be difficult to understand visually. The graph in Figure 1.9 is a Pareto chart. The Pareto chart has the bars sorted from largest to smallest and is easier to read and interpret.</p>
<p>Pie Charts: No Missing Data The following pie charts have the “Other/Unknown” category included (since the percentages must add to 100%). The chart in Figure 1.10(b) is organized by the size of each wedge, which makes it a more visually informative graph than the unsorted, alphabetical graph in Figure 1.10(a).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sampling">Sampling</h2>
<section id="simple-random-sample" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="simple-random-sample">Simple Random Sample</h3>
<p>Gathering information about an entire population often costs too much or is virtually impossible. Instead, we use a <strong>sample</strong> of the population. A sample <strong>should have the same characteristics</strong> as the population it is representing. Most statisticians use various methods of random sampling in an attempt to achieve this goal. This section will describe a few of the most common methods.</p>
<p>There are several different methods of random sampling. In each form of <strong>random sampling</strong>, each member of a population initially has an equal chance of being selected for the sample. Each method has pros and cons. The easiest method to describe is called a <strong>simple random sample</strong>. Any group of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> individuals is equally likely to be chosen as any other group of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> individuals if the simple random sampling technique is used. In other words, each sample of the same size has an equal chance of being selected.</p>
<p>For example, suppose Lisa wants to form a four-person study group (herself and three other people) from her pre-calculus class, which has 31 members not including Lisa. To choose a simple random sample of size three from the other members of her class, Lisa could put all 31 names in a hat, shake the hat, close her eyes, and pick out three names. A more technological way is for Lisa to first list the last names of the members of her class together with a two-digit number:</p>
<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>ID</th>
<th>Name</th>
<th>ID</th>
<th>Name</th>
<th>ID</th>
<th>Name</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>00</td>
<td>Anselmo</td>
<td>11</td>
<td>King</td>
<td>21</td>
<td>Roquero</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>01 Bautista 12 Legeny 22 Roth 02 Bayani 13 Lundquist 23 Rowell 03 Cheng 14 Macierz 24 Salangsang 04 Cuarismo 15 Motogawa 25 Slade 05 Cuningham 16 Okimoto 26 Stratcher 06 Fontecha 17 Patel 27 Tallai 07 Hong 18 Price 28 Tran 08 Hoobler 19 Quizon 29 Wai 09 Jiao 20 Reyes 30 Wood 10 Khan</p>
<p>Lisa can use a table of random numbers (found in many statistics books and mathematical handbooks), a calculator, or a computer to generate random numbers. The numbers generated are as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.94360;%200.99832;%200.14669;%200.51470;%200.40581;%200.73381;%200.04399"></p>
<p>Lisa reads two-digit groups until she has chosen three class members (that is, she reads 0.94360 as the groups 94, 43, 36, 60). Each random number may only contribute one class member. If she needed to, Lisa could have generated more random numbers.</p>
<p>The random numbers <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.94360"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.99832"> do not contain appropriate two digit numbers. However the third random number, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0.14669">, contains <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?14"> (the fourth random number also contains <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?14">), the fifth random number contains <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?05">, and the seventh random number contains <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?04">. The two-digit number <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?14"> corresponds to Macierz, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?05"> corresponds to Cuningham, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?04"> corresponds to Cuarismo. Besides herself, Lisa’s group will consist of Marcierz, Cuningham, and Cuarismo.</p>
<p>Besides **simple random sampling*, there are other forms of sampling that involve a chance process for getting the sample. Other well-known random sampling methods are the <strong>stratified sample</strong>, the **cluster sample*, and the <strong>systematic sample</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section id="stratified-sample" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stratified-sample">Stratified Sample</h3>
<p>To choose a <strong>stratified sample</strong>, divide the population into groups called strata and then take a proportionate number from each stratum. For example, you could stratify (group) your college population by department and then choose a proportionate simple random sample from each stratum (each department) to get a stratified random sample. To choose a simple random sample from each department, number each member of the first department, number each member of the second department, and do the same for the remaining departments. Then use simple random sampling to choose proportionate numbers from the first department and do the same for each of the remaining departments. Those numbers picked from the first department, picked from the second department, and so on represent the members who make up the stratified sample.</p>
</section>
<section id="cluster-sample" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cluster-sample">Cluster Sample</h3>
<p>To choose a cluster sample, divide the population into clusters (groups) and then randomly select some of the clusters. All the members from these clusters are in the cluster sample. For example, if you randomly sample four departments from your college population, the four departments make up the cluster sample. Divide your college faculty by department. The departments are the clusters. Number each department, and then choose four different numbers using simple random sampling. All members of the four departments with those numbers are the cluster sample.</p>
</section>
<section id="systematic-sample" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="systematic-sample">Systematic Sample</h3>
<p>To choose a systematic sample, randomly select a starting point and take every nth piece of data from a listing of the population. For example, suppose you have to do a phone survey. Your phone book contains 20,000 residence listings. You must choose 400 names for the sample. Number the population 1–20,000 and then use a simple random sample to pick a number that represents the first name in the sample. Then choose every fiftieth name thereafter until you have a total of 400 names (you might have to go back to the beginning of your phone list). Systematic sampling is frequently chosen because it is a simple method.</p>
<p>A type of sampling that is non-random is convenience sampling. Convenience sampling involves using results that are readily available. For example, a computer software store conducts a marketing study by interviewing potential customers who happen to be in the store browsing through the available software. The results of convenience sampling may be very good in some cases and highly biased (favor certain outcomes) in others.</p>
<p>Sampling data should be done very carefully. Collecting data carelessly can have devastating results. Surveys mailed to households and then returned may be very biased (they may favor a certain group). It is better for the person conducting the survey to select the sample respondents.</p>
<p>True random sampling is done with replacement. That is, once a member is picked, that member goes back into the population and thus may be chosen more than once. However for practical reasons, in most populations, simple random sampling is done without replacement. Surveys are typically done without replacement. That is, a member of the population may be chosen only once. Most samples are taken from large populations and the sample tends to be small in comparison to the population. Since this is the case, sampling without replacement is approximately the same as sampling with replacement because the chance of picking the same individual more than once with replacement is very low.</p>
<p>Sampling without replacement instead of sampling with replacement becomes a mathematical issue only when the population is small.</p>
<p>When you analyze data, it is important to be aware of sampling errors and nonsampling errors. The actual process of sampling causes sampling errors. For example, the sample may not be large enough. Factors not related to the sampling process cause nonsampling errors. A defective counting device can cause a nonsampling error.</p>
<p>In reality, a sample will never be exactly representative of the population so there will always be some sampling error. As a rule, the larger the sample, the smaller the sampling error.</p>
<p>In statistics, a sampling bias is created when a sample is collected from a population and some members of the population are not as likely to be chosen as others (remember, each member of the population should have an equally likely chance of being chosen). When a sampling bias happens, there can be incorrect conclusions drawn about the population that is being studied.</p>
<p>Critical Evaluation We need to evaluate the statistical studies we read about critically and analyze them before accepting the results of the studies. Common problems to be aware of include:</p>
<pre><code>Problems with samples: A sample must be representative of the population. A sample that is not representative of the population is biased. Biased samples that are not representative of the population give results that are inaccurate and not valid.
Self-selected samples: Responses only by people who choose to respond, such as call-in surveys, are often unreliable.
Sample size issues: Samples that are too small may be unreliable. Larger samples are better, if possible. In some situations, having small samples is unavoidable and can still be used to draw conclusions. Examples: crash testing cars or medical testing for rare conditions
Undue influence: collecting data or asking questions in a way that influences the response
Non-response or refusal of subject to participate: The collected responses may no longer be representative of the population. Often, people with strong positive or negative opinions may answer surveys, which can affect the results.
Causality: A relationship between two variables does not mean that one causes the other to occur. They may be related (correlated) because of their relationship through a different variable.
Self-funded or self-interest studies: A study performed by a person or organization in order to support their claim. Is the study impartial? Read the study carefully to evaluate the work. Do not automatically assume that the study is good, but do not automatically assume the study is bad either. Evaluate it on its merits and the work done.
Misleading use of data: improperly displayed graphs, incomplete data, or lack of context
Confounding: When the effects of multiple factors on a response cannot be separated. Confounding makes it difficult or impossible to draw valid conclusions about the effect of each factor.</code></pre>
<p>Variation in Data</p>
<p>Variation is present in any set of data. For example, 16-ounce cans of beverage may contain more or less than 16 ounces of liquid. In one study, eight 16 ounce cans were measured and produced the following amount (in ounces) of beverage:</p>
<p>15.8; 16.1; 15.2; 14.8; 15.8; 15.9; 16.0; 15.5</p>
<p>Measurements of the amount of beverage in a 16-ounce can may vary because different people make the measurements or because the exact amount, 16 ounces of liquid, was not put into the cans. Manufacturers regularly run tests to determine if the amount of beverage in a 16-ounce can falls within the desired range.</p>
<p>Be aware that as you take data, your data may vary somewhat from the data someone else is taking for the same purpose. This is completely natural. However, if two or more of you are taking the same data and get very different results, it is time for you and the others to reevaluate your data-taking methods and your accuracy.</p>
<iframe height="400" width="100%" frameborder="no" src="https://guillaumegilles.shinyapps.io/my_app/">
</iframe>
<p>Variation in Samples It was mentioned previously that two or more samples from the same population, taken randomly, and having close to the same characteristics of the population will likely be different from each other. Suppose Doreen and Jung both decide to study the average amount of time students at their college sleep each night. Doreen and Jung each take samples of 500 students. Doreen uses systematic sampling and Jung uses cluster sampling. Doreen’s sample will be different from Jung’s sample. Even if Doreen and Jung used the same sampling method, in all likelihood their samples would be different. Neither would be wrong, however.</p>
<p>Think about what contributes to making Doreen’s and Jung’s samples different.</p>
<p>If Doreen and Jung took larger samples (i.e.&nbsp;the number of data values is increased), their sample results (the average amount of time a student sleeps) might be closer to the actual population average. But still, their samples would be, in all likelihood, different from each other. This variability in samples cannot be stressed enough.</p>
<p>Size of a Sample The size of a sample (often called the number of observations, usually given the symbol n) is important. The examples you have seen in this book so far have been small. Samples of only a few hundred observations, or even smaller, are sufficient for many purposes. In polling, samples that are from 1,200 to 1,500 observations are considered large enough and good enough if the survey is random and is well done. Later we will find that even much smaller sample sizes will give very good results. You will learn why when you study confidence intervals.</p>
<p>Be aware that many large samples are biased. For example, call-in surveys are invariably biased, because people choose to respond or not.</p>
