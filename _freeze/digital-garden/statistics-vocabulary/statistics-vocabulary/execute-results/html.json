We want to know\nthe average (mean) amount of money first year college students spend at ABC\nCollege on school supplies that do not include books. We randomly surveyed 100\nfirst year students at the college. Three of those students spent $150, $200,\nand $225, respectively.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Solution\n\n- The **population** is all first year students attending ABC College this term.\n- The **sample** could be all students enrolled in one section of a beginning\nstatistics course at ABC College (although this sample may not represent the\nentire population).\n- The **parameter** is the average (mean) amount of money spent (excluding\nbooks) by first year college students at ABC College this term: the population\nmean.\n- The **statistic** is the average (mean) amount of money spent (excluding\nbooks) by first year college students in the sample.\n- The **variable** could be the amount of money spent (excluding books) by one\nfirst year student. Let X = the amount of money spent (excluding books) by one\nfirst year student attending ABC College.\n- The **data** are the dollar amounts spent by the first year students. Examples\nof the data are $150, $200, and $225.\n:::\n\n### Example 2\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Problem\n\nDetermine what the key terms refer to in the following study.\n\nA study was conducted at a local college to analyze the average cumulative GPA’s\nof students who graduated last year. For each statement below find the\nappropriate statistical term.\n\n1. The cumulative GPA of one student who graduated from the college last year.\n2. 3.65, 2.80, 1.50, 3.90\n3. A group of students who graduated from the college last year, randomly selected.\n4. The average cumulative GPA of students who graduated from the college last year.\n5. All students who graduated from the college last year.\n6. the average cumulative GPA of students in the study who graduated from the\ncollege last year.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Solution\n\n1. Population: **5**\n2. Statistic: **6**\n3. Parameter: **4**\n4. Sample: **3**\n5. Variable: **1**\n6. Data: **2**\n:::\n\n### Example 3\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Problem\n\nDetermine what the key terms refer to in the following study.\n\nAs part of a study designed to test the safety of electric automobiles, the\nNational Transportation Safety Board collected and reviewed data about the\neffects of an automobile crash on test dummies. Here is the criterion they\nused:\n\n| Speed at which cars crashed |\tLocation of “drive” (i.e. dummies) |\n|:--------------------------- | :----------------------------------|\n| 35 miles/hour \t          | Front Seat                         |\n\nCars with dummies in the front seats were crashed into a wall at a speed of 35\nmiles per hour. We want to know the proportion of dummies in the driver’s seat\nthat would have had head injuries, if they had been actual drivers. We start\nwith a simple random sample of 75 cars.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Solution\n\n- The **population** is all cars containing dummies in the front seat.\n- The **sample** is the 75 cars, selected by a simple random sample.\n- The **parameter** is the proportion of driver dummies (if they had been real\npeople) who would have suffered head injuries in the population.\n- The **statistic** is proportion of driver dummies (if they had been real\npeople) who would have suffered head injuries in the sample.\n- The **variable** $X =$ whether a dummy (if it had been a real person) would\nhave suffered head injuries.\n- The **data** are either: yes, had head injury, or no, did not.\n:::\n\n## To recap\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.4     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD;\n    population[Population]==> |a portion (or subset) of the population|sample(Sample);\n    sample --> statistic(Statistic);\n    B --> D;\n    C --> D;\n```\n\n\n::: {layout=\"[[0.4, 1], [1]]\"}\n![iPhone Weather App](../../assets/images/iphone-weather-app.gif)\n\nYou are probably asking yourself the question, \"When and where will I use \nstatistics?\" If you read any newspaper, watch television, check weather forecast\nor use the Internet, you will see statistical information. There are statistics\nabout crime, sports, education, politics, and real estate. Typically, when you\nread a newspaper article or watch a television news program, you are given\nsample information. With this information, you may make a decision about the\ncorrectness of a statement, claim, or \"fact.\" Statistical methods can help you\nmake the \"best educated guess.\" Since you will undoubtedly be given statistical\ninformation at some point in your life, you need to know some techniques for\nanalyzing the information thoughtfully. Think about buying a house or managing a\nbudget. Think about your chosen profession. The fields of economics, business,\npsychology, education, biology, law, computer science, police science, and early\nchildhood development require at least one course in statistics.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nIncluded in this chapter are the basic ideas and words of probability and\nstatistics. You will soon understand that statistics and probability work\ntogether. You will also learn how data are gathered and what \"good\" data can be\ndistinguished from \"bad.\"\n:::\n",
