Welcome to **Introduction to Business Statistics**, IBS, a web textbook I've
created to use in my statistics classes at ESSCA, Bordeaux.

## About Introduction to Business Statistics

Introduction to Business Statistics is designed to meet the scope and
requirements of one-semester statistics course for business, economics,
and related majors for undergraduate students in business school. Core
statistical concepts and skills have been augmented with practical business
examples, scenarios, and exercises. The result is a meaningful understanding
of the discipline which will serve students in their business careers and
real-world experiences.
