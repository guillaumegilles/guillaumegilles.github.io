::: {.callout-note}

In publishing, a [colophon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing)) (/ˈkɒləfən, -fɒn/) is a brief statement containing information about the publication of a book such as an "imprint" (the place of publication, the publisher, and the date of publication). A colophon may include the device logo  of a printer or publisher. Colophons are traditionally printed at the ends of books, but sometimes the same information appears elsewhere and many modern (post-1800) books bear this information on the title page or on the verso of the title leaf, which is sometimes called a biblio page or the copyright page.
