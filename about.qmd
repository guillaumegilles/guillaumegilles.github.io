Nice to meet you and welcome to my website, a corner of the Internet where I
cultivate my [digital garden](index.qmd).

I’m Guillaume Gilles, a data analyst at [Banque de France](https://www.banque-france.fr/en)
and an adjunct professor at [INSEEC](https://www.inseec.com/en/) and [ESSCA](https://www.essca.fr/en).
I am passionate about machine learning! I strive to understand how machine
learning algorithms are applied to solve real-world problems and I enjoy every
part of a machine learning lifecycle: data preparation, modelization, and
reporting to stakeholders.

I studied economics, finance, and computer science, but mostly, I’m a lifelong
learner! I worked as a financial analyst before moving into data science in 2020.

When I am not working, I am trying my best to be a husband, father of one son,
and a cat owner. I love taking care of my cat, Othello a.k.a. skekCoon based on
[Skeksis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeksis) and his breed, [Mainecoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine_Coon).
