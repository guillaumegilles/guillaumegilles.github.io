:::{#hero-heading}

I’m Guillaume Gilles, a data analyst at [Banque de France](https://www.banque-france.fr/en)
and an adjunct professor at [INSEEC](https://www.inseec.com/en/) and [ESSCA](https://www.essca.fr/en).
I am passionate about machine learning! I strive to understand how machine
learning algorithms are applied to solve real-world problems and I enjoy every
part of a machine learning lifecycle: data preparation, modelization, and
reporting to stakeholders.

I studied economics, finance, and computer science, but mostly, I’m a lifelong
learner! I worked as a financial analyst before moving into data science in 2020.

When I am not working, I am trying my best to be a husband, father of one son,
and a cat owner. I love taking care of my cat, Othello a.k.a. skekCoon based on
[Skeksis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeksis) and his breed, [Mainecoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine_Coon).

## Colophon

::: {.callout-note}
In publishing, a [colophon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing)) (/ˈkɒləfən, -fɒn/)[1] is a brief statement containing information about the publication of a book such as an "imprint" (the place of publication, the publisher, and the date of publication).[2]

A colophon may include the device (logo)[2]: 69  of a printer or publisher. Colophons are traditionally printed at the ends of books (see History below for the origin of the word), but sometimes the same information appears elsewhere (when it may still be referred to as colophon) and many modern (post-1800) books bear this information on the title page[2] or on the verso of the title leaf,[3] which is sometimes called a biblio page or (when bearing copyright data) the copyright page.[4]
