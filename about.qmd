# From finance to firewalls — I secure what matters.

> I’m **Guillaume Gilles**, a former Banque de France financial analyst
> who now channels a decade of risk assessment and teaching into
> cybersecurity.

For over ten years at the **Banque de France**, I decoded macroeconomic
patterns, assessed corporate resilience, and produced strategic
insight for decision-makers. My academic side ran parallel — teaching
statistics, financial analysis, and information systems at top
business schools, instilling analytical rigor and adaptability.

Hands-on with [GitHub](https://github.com/skekcoon), I write,
experiment, and explore: bridging data, defense, and human behavior to
uncover and harden vulnerabilities.

Today, I’m immersed in **cybersecurity**, building skills in digital
forensics, secure network design, and incident investigation. My passion
lies at the nexus of data, security safeguards, and the behaviors that
drive human error.
