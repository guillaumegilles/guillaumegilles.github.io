:::{#hero-heading}

I’m Guillaume Gilles, a data analyst at [Banque de France](https://www.banque-france.fr/en) and an adjunct professor at [INSEEC](https://www.inseec.com/en/) and [ESSCA](https://www.essca.fr/en).
I am passionate about machine learning! I strive to understand how machine learning algorithms are applied to solve real-world problems and I enjoy every part of a machine learning lifecycle: data preparation, modelization, and reporting to stakeholders.

I studied economics, finance, and computer science, but mostly, I’m a lifelong
learner! I worked as a financial analyst before moving into data science in 2020.

When I am not working, I am trying my best to be a husband, father of one son,
and a cat owner. I love taking care of my cat, Othello a.k.a. skekCoon based on
[Skeksis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeksis) and his breed, [Mainecoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine_Coon).

## Colophon

::: {.callout-note}
In publishing, a [colophon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing)) (/ˈkɒləfən, -fɒn/) is a brief statement containing information about the publication of a book such as an "imprint" (the place of publication, the publisher, and the date of publication).
A colophon may include the device logo  of a printer or publisher.
Colophons are traditionally printed at the ends of books, but sometimes the same information appears elsewhere and many modern (post-1800) books bear this information on the title page or on the verso of the title leaf, which is sometimes called a biblio page or the copyright page.
