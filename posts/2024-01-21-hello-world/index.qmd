Hi everyone!

I’ve been thinking to create a website, and more pricesly a blog, for a while now. I’ve never crossed the line of hypothesis until now, by fear of being judged. Expressing one’s thoughts on the web is intimidating and daunting. But I supposed the desire to have a place of my own to talk about thing that resonnate to me and pet projects I am working on is a stronger driving force than lack of self confidence.

As an aspirying machine learning engineer, blog posts are great opportunities to showcase your work. According to Chip Huyen, it is a great place to demonstrate “examples that convinced me of a candidate’s expertise in certain technology [...] a blog post that covers in-depth detail about X that made our team go: Whoa, they really know about X.” [@huyenWhatWeLook2023]

For David Robinson, a blog is the best advice for someone wanted to start a data science career. It helps to:

1. **Practice analyzing data and communicating about it**: it can be easily resumed to "practice makes perfect" or in French: "C'est en forgeant qu'on devient forgeron".
2. **Create a portfolio of your work and skills**: after spending hours and nights practicing your data science craft, a blog is a valuable medium to share your work. This piece of advice works well for established data scientists as well.
3. **Get feedback and evaluation**: creating a community and interacting with an audience helps individuals to reach for better. [@robinsonAdviceAspiringData2017]
