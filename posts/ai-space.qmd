title: "AI Space"
abstract: |
  You are assigned the important mission of locating and identifying the
  infamous space hacker. Your investigation begins by analyzing the data
  patterns and breach points identified in the latest cyber-attacks. Use the
  provided coordinates of the last known signal origins to narrow down his
  potential hideouts. Utilize advanced tracking algorithms to follow the digital
  footprint left by the hacker.

AI Space is a [challenge](https://app.hackthebox.com/challenges/AI%2520SPACE)
designed by [karamuz](https://app.hackthebox.com/users/290068). It starts with
a NumPy file, `distance_matrix.npy`. NumPy is a Python library to operate on
multidimensional arrays,  _a.k.a._ matrices.

## Why use NumPy?

Python's lists can be "heterogeneous", meaning they can contain elements of
dirrent types (`integer`, `string`, `boolean`, etc.), and are quite fast.

```python
list = [4, "banana", TRUE]
```

data structure to store homogeneous multidimensional array, `ndarray`,

## Reading `distance_matrix.npy`

```python
import numpy as np
a = np.load("distance_matrix.npy")
a.shape
```
Your matrix has $2$ dimensions 


```python
a.shape
a.dtype.name
a.size
type(a)
```

Each dimentsion countain $1808$, `(1808, 1808)`, of `float64 `data points, so a size of `3268864`.

```python
print(a)
```
