## Overview

This website serves as a platform for showcasing my [digital garden](https://guillaumegilles.github.io/digital-garden/), sharing my thoughts and experiences through essays, and providing information about my skills and projects.
It is designed to be user-friendly, visually appealing, and accessible across various devices.

## Technologies Used

### [Git](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/https://github.com/guillaumegilles/guillaumegilles.github.io
```

### Built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)

**Quarto** is used as the primary framework for building the website.
It is a modern and flexible platform for creating interactive and data-driven documents.

1. [Install Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
2. Render the entire directory to create the website:

```shell
quarto render
```

### Host on [Github Pages](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html)

The simplest way to publish using GitHub Pages is to render to the `docs` directory and then check that directory into your repository. If you prefer not to check rendered output into version control you can use [Publish Command](Publishing).
