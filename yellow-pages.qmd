::: {.callout-note}
The [yellow pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_pages) are telephone directories of businesses, organized by category rather than alphabetically by business name. The directories were originally printed on yellow paper, as opposed to white pages for non-commercial listings. The traditional term "yellow pages" is now also applied to online directories of businesses.
