### Hi! I appreciate you dropping by.

Nice to meet you and welcome to my website, a corner of the Internet where I cultivate my digital garden.

I’m Guillaume Gilles, a data analyst at [Banque de France](https://www.banque-france.fr/en) and an adjunct professor at [INSEEC](https://www.inseec.com/en/) and [ESSCA](https://www.essca.fr/en). I am passionate about machine learning! I strive to understand how machine learning algorithms are applied to solve real-world problems and I enjoy every part of a machine learning lifecycle: data preparation, modelization, and reporting to stakeholders.

I studied economics, finance, and computer science, but mostly, I’m a lifelong learner! I worked as a financial analyst before moving into data science in 2020.

When I am not working, I am trying my best to be a husband, father of one son, and a cat owner. I love taking care of my cat, Othello, a.k.a. skekCoon based on [Skeksis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeksis) and his bread, Mainecoon.

Feel free to [reach out to me](contact.qmd)!
