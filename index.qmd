I’m Economist - statistician at [Banque de France](https://www.banque-france.fr/en) and an adjunct professor at both [INSEEC](https://www.inseec.com/en/) and [ESSCA](https://www.essca.fr/en). With a passion for machine learning, I thrive in every phase of the machine learning lifecycle—from data preparation to modeling, and ultimately translating insights to stakeholders in ways that drive decision-making.

## How to Navigate My Website  

- **Blog**: Richard Feynman, while he was a student, developed a learning technique to deepen his knowledge. His learning process revolved around four key steps.  

  1. **Explain the subject to a child** – He would write down everything he knew about the topic as if he were teaching it to an 11-year-old child or even a rubber duck on his desk. It was crucial to use simple words and eliminate technical jargon, as such terms often mask a lack of true understanding. They can simply be a repetition of what we've heard elsewhere. Clarity and conciseness were key since a child's attention span is limited.  

  2. **Identify gaps in understanding** – Any difficult or unclear sections in his explanation indicated areas that needed further study.  

  3. **Organize and simplify** – He refined his notes to ensure they conveyed a single, clear subject.  

  4. **Transmit knowledge** – He iterated over the previous three steps multiple times, improving his understanding and teaching abilities. His commitment to clear explanations made him a great teacher. Feedback from others helped him gauge whether he could present the subject in a simple and effective way.  

  My blog posts are inspired by Feynman’s learning technique. They represent the fourth step of my process—where I publish my insights on a subject. By reading these posts, you can explore what's currently on my mind.  

- **Projects**: Once several related blog posts form a more coherent and complete project, I dedicate a section of my digital garden to it. This area also includes side projects, such as my Kaggle competition entries.  

- **Teaching**: A standalone website containing my course materials. Here, you can learn about financial credit risk analysis, descriptive and inferential statistics, and more.
