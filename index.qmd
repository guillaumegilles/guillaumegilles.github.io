# Hello there!

## Welcome on my website

I’m Guillaume Gilles, a data analyst at [Banque de France](https://www.banque-france.fr/en)
and an adjunct professor at both [INSEEC](https://www.inseec.com/en/)
and [ESSCA](https://www.essca.fr/en). With a passion for machine learning,
I thrive in every phase of the machine learning lifecycle—from data
preparation to modeling, and ultimately translating insights to
stakeholders in ways that drive decision-making.

:::

The web design phI'm building this space with the philosophy of a "[digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)."
The idea originated in 1998 when [Mark Bernstein](https://www.markbernstein.org/)
introduced the concept of a "hypertext garden," advocating for online
spaces that invite curiosity and encourage exploration at one’s own pace.
Unlike traditional blogs, which feature polished articles arranged in
reverse chronological order, digital gardens are dynamic and evolving—more
like open wikis. Here, ideas grow, change, and develop over time,
reflecting an ongoing journey of learning and sharing.

## Now

### Reading

[Quand la machine apprend](https://www.odilejacob.fr/catalogue/sciences/informatique/quand-la-machine-apprend_9782738149312.php),
Yann Le Cun

ChatGPT translation of the back cover:

"We are living through an unprecedented revolution, unimaginable fifty
years ago: the revolution of machines that learn—and learn on their own.
Instead of merely executing the commands of a program, machines can now
acquire, through experience, the abilities needed to perform assigned
tasks, including those once thought to be exclusively human. The
applications are vast: pattern recognition, voice, image, and facial
recognition, self-driving cars, translation of hundreds of languages,
tumor detection in medical imaging…

Yann LeCun is at the forefront of this revolution. He is one of the
inventors of deep learning, the technology that characterizes artificial
neural networks, whose architecture and functioning are inspired by the
brain. Yann LeCun invites us to explore the birth of this new form of
intelligence, the emergence of a system that is almost self-organizing.

This book delves into the intellectual journey of an inventor at the
intersection of computer science and neuroscience. A book that sheds
light on the future of artificial intelligence—its challenges, promises,
and risks. A fascinating, clear, and accessible book that takes us into
the heartof the machine and introduces us to a new and fascinating world
that is already our own.

Yann LeCun, winner of the Turing Award, is a professor at New York
University and leads fundamental research at Facebook."

engineering, fine-tuning, RAG, etc.


<!-- ## Yellow Pages

::: {.callout-note}
The [yellow pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_pages) are
telephone directories of businesses, organized by category rather than
alphabetically by business name. The directories were originally printed
on yellow paper, as opposed to white pages for non-commercial listings.
The traditional term "yellow pages" is now also applied to online
directories of businesses.

## Colophon

::: {.callout-important}

## Wikipedia definiton

In publishing, a [colophon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing))
(/ˈkɒləfən, -fɒn/) is a short statement providing details about a book’s
publication—typically including the imprint, which covers the place of
publication, the publisher, and the date. Colophons may also feature a
printer or publisher's logo. Traditionally, colophons appear at the end
of books, though in many modern works (post-1800), this information has
moved to the title page or the verso of the title leaf, also known as the
copyright or biblio page.
