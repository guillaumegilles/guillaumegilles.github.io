:::{#hero-heading}
## Hello there! Welcome on my website

I’m Guillaume Gilles, a data analyst at [Banque de France](https://www.banque-france.fr/en)
and an adjunct professor at both [INSEEC](https://www.inseec.com/en/)
and [ESSCA](https://www.essca.fr/en). With a passion for machine learning,
I dive deep into how algorithms can be harnessed to tackle real-world
challenges, and I thrive in every phase of the machine learning
lifecycle—from data preparation to modeling, and ultimately translating
insights to stakeholders in ways that drive decision-making.

My academic background spans economics, finance, and computer science,
and my journey from financial analyst to data scientist has been fueled
by a constant drive to learn and adapt. Since making the switch to data
science in 2020, I've focused on building expertise in both foundational
and cutting-edge methods in the field.

Outside of work, I’m dedicated to being a husband, father to a young son,
and caretaker of a Maine Coon cat named Othello—affectionately known as
"skekCoon," a playful nod to his [Skeksis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeksis)
-like appearance.
:::


I'm building this space with the philosophy of a "[digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)."
The idea originated in 1998 when [Mark Bernstein](https://www.markbernstein.org/)
introduced the concept of a "hypertext garden," advocating for online
spaces that invite curiosity and encourage exploration at one’s own pace.
Unlike traditional blogs, which feature polished articles arranged in
reverse chronological order, digital gardens are dynamic and evolving—more
like open wikis. Here, ideas grow, change, and develop over time,
reflecting an ongoing journey of learning and sharing.

### Listening

**The Beatles, ‘Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band’** - CAPITOL, 1967

For the Beatles, it was a decisive goodbye to screaming crowds, world tours, and assembly-line record making.
“We were fed up with being Beatles,” Paul McCartney said decades later.
“We were not boys, we were men … artists rather than performers.”
Sgt. Pepper christened the Summer of Love with the lavish psychedelic daydream “Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,” the jaunty Ringo Starr-sung communality anthem “With a Little Help From My Friends,” the album-closing multilayered masterwork, “A Day in the Life,” and the title track, which introduced the alter egos the Beatles had developed for the ambitious project.
“It liberated you,” McCartney said. “You could do anything.”
It is hard to imagine a more perfect setting for the Victorian jollity of John Lennon’s “Being for the Beneﬁt of Mr. Kite!” (inspired by an 1843 circus poster) or the sumptuous melancholy of McCartney’s “Fixing a Hole,” with its blend of antique shadows (a harpsichord played by the Beatles’ producer George Martin) and modern sunshine lead guitar executed with ringing precision by George Harrison).
The Sgt. Pepper premise was a license to take their music in every direction — rock spent the rest of the Sixties trying to keep up. [@stone500GreatestAlbums2023]

## Yellow Pages

::: {.callout-note}
The [yellow pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_pages) are
telephone directories of businesses, organized by category rather than
alphabetically by business name. The directories were originally printed
on yellow paper, as opposed to white pages for non-commercial listings.
The traditional term "yellow pages" is now also applied to online
directories of businesses.

## Colophon

::: {.callout-note}
In publishing, a [colophon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing))
(/ˈkɒləfən, -fɒn/) is a short statement providing details about a book’s
publication—typically including the imprint, which covers the place of
publication, the publisher, and the date. Colophons may also feature a
printer or publisher's logo. Traditionally, colophons appear at the end
of books, though in many modern works (post-1800), this information has
moved to the title page or the verso of the title leaf, also known as the
copyright or biblio page.
