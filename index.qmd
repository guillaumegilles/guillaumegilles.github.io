### Hi! Welcome on my personal website, a corner of Internet to cultivate my digital garden.

I am passionate about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning! I strive to understand how machine learning algorithms are applied to solve real-world problems. I enjoy every part of a machine learning lifecycle: data preparation, modelization, and reporting to stakeholders.
