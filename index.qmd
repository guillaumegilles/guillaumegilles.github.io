# Yellow Pages

::: {.callout-note}
The [yellow pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_pages) are
telephone directories of businesses, organized by category rather than
alphabetically by business name. The directories were originally printed
on yellow paper, as opposed to white pages for non-commercial listings.
The traditional term "yellow pages" is now also applied to online
directories of businesses.
